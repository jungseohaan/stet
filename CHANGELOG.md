and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`--crop-box <llx> <lly> <urx> <ury>` for `--device png`, and
  `render_region_prepared_with_background` in `stet-render`.** Renders only
  the named region of the page instead of the whole page, in points in the
  PDF's own user space, as the page boxes are written. Placed artwork cropped
  to a small part of a large artboard no longer pays to rasterize the whole
  artboard: on a 2560x1600 pt illustration cropped to a 491x1238 pt strip,
  rendering the region takes 51s against 90s for the page, pixel for pixel the
  same result. PDF input only, and not with `--width`/`--height`.
  `PdfDocument::device_region_for_box` maps a user-space rectangle to the
  device pixels `render_page` produces, through the same CTM the page is drawn
  with, so a page with `/Rotate` gives the region the artwork occupies.

- **`--transparent` for `--device png`, and `render_to_rgba_with_background`
  in `stet-render`.** Pages are rendered onto a transparent backdrop and
  composited onto white paper only as the last step; the option skips that
  step and writes straight-alpha RGBA instead, so artwork (EPS, AI, PDF) can
  be placed over other content with its unpainted areas clear. Both the
  PostScript and PDF input paths honour it, on the banded and the full-page
  path alike. The library says which through `PageBackground::{White,
  Transparent}`, on `render_to_rgba_with_background` and
  `SkiaDevice::set_page_background`; `render_to_rgba` and
  `render_to_rgba_with_layers` keep their signatures and white paper.
- **`--cmyk-intent perceptual|relative`, and `IccCacheOptions::cmyk_source_table`.**
  The CLUT bake samples the source CMYK profile's `A2B1` (relative) table,
  which for a print profile is a good deal lighter in the blacks than the
  `A2B0` (perceptual) table that lcms2, Ghostscript and ImageMagick use by
  default: Japan Color 2001 Coated renders K100 as (51,45,43) rather than
  (35,25,22). The option selects the perceptual table, which reproduces
  lcms2's default to within 1 RGB level over a 60-patch CMYK sweep. The
  default is unchanged (relative), and a profile without a perceptual table
  falls back to the colorimetric one.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-09-24

### Added

- **`DisplayElement::TextRun`, a display-list element for text
  extraction,** with `TextRunParams`, `ShownGlyph` and `UnicodeSource` in
  `stet_graphics::device` (re-exported by the `stet` facade). A run is a
  stretch of shown text in one font along one baseline, however many show
  operations displayed it, in Unicode, with each glyph's device-space
  origin and advance, its character code, and where its text came from;
  `glyph_to_device`, `ascent` and `descent` give each glyph's box, rotated
  or skewed like the text, `start` and `end` span the run, `vertical` marks
  vertical writing, and `word_breaks` marks where words were set apart by
  distance rather than by a space character, as TeX sets them. The rule
  that cuts runs and finds word gaps is `TextRunParams::step_to`, in the
  new `stet_graphics::text` module, which both producers share. It paints
  nothing, and every renderer and the PDF writer skip it. Both producers
  take a `TextExtraction` level, `Off` by default —
  `InterpreterBuilder::text_extraction` (or `Context::text_extraction`) for
  PostScript and `PdfDocument::set_text_extraction` for PDF. With it off,
  display lists are unchanged; `Glyphs` records runs with every glyph, and
  `Runs` the same runs with `glyphs` left empty, in about half the memory,
  for callers that want a page's text and lines but not each glyph's
  place. Both record runs (below). Renderers that match on
  `DisplayElement` already have the wildcard arm the enum's
  `#[non_exhaustive]` requires.
- **Text extraction from PDF.** With `PdfDocument::set_text_extraction`,
  the text-showing operators (`Tj`, `TJ`, `'`, `"`) record `TextRun`s
  beside the glyphs they draw — in forms, annotation appearances, layers and
  transparency groups, nested like the content, so a viewer extracts only
  visible layers' text with the `LayerSet` it renders with. Text inside an
  `/ActualText` marked-content span is the span's text — the author's
  statement of what ligatures, symbols or drawn characters say, or, when
  empty, that a glyph such as a line-end hyphen says nothing: the span's
  first glyph carries it all and the rest none, the outermost span wins,
  and forms drawn inside the span are covered by it. Outside a span, a
  glyph's text comes from the font's `/ToUnicode` CMap, else its glyph
  name through the Adobe Glyph List, else — for CJK fonts on Adobe's Japan1, CNS1, GB1 and
  Korea1 collections, or with a `Uni…` encoding CMap — its CID or code;
  failing all of those it is left empty. One rule is a heuristic, taken
  from Poppler so TeX documents made with dvips extract: a glyph name
  outside the AGL that spells a number (`a80`, `g65`) is read as that
  character code in Latin-1. Invisible text
  (render modes 3 and 7, as OCR layers use) is recorded and flagged. Text
  that is not the document's is not recorded: text drawn inside a Type 3
  glyph procedure (the glyph is the text), in a tiling pattern cell, or in
  a soft-mask group.
- **Text extraction from PostScript.** With
  `InterpreterBuilder::text_extraction`, every show operator — `show`,
  `ashow`, `widthshow`, `awidthshow`, `kshow`, `xshow`, `yshow`, `xyshow`
  and `glyphshow` — records `TextRun`s for Type 1, CFF, Type 42
  and Type 3 fonts, and for composite fonts: CID-keyed (CFF and
  TrueType, horizontal and vertical) and FMapType, a new run starting
  wherever the descendant font changes. Text comes from each glyph's name
  through the Adobe Glyph List (with the same dvips numeric-name rule as
  PDF); for a CIDFont, from the character code when the CMap is a `Uni…`
  one, else from the CID through Adobe's Japan1, CNS1, GB1 or Korea1
  table. PostScript has no ToUnicode, so a font whose glyph names mean
  nothing gives empty text. Glyph space is the font's own, with ascent and
  descent from its `FontBBox` (a TrueType font's `hhea` table; for a
  Type 3 font with an empty `FontBBox`, as dvips writes, its glyphs'
  `setcachedevice` boxes). Text drawn inside a
  Type 3 `BuildChar` / `BuildGlyph` or a pattern cell is not recorded; a
  `show` inside a `kshow` procedure carries on the kshow's run, and one
  inside a `cshow` procedure records the whole character
  code `cshow` selected (its procedure sees only the last byte). Forms
  record once and are placed wherever `execform` draws them. A
  `glyphshow` glyph, shown by name, records code 0.
- **`stet text <file>`**, a CLI subcommand that prints the text a PDF,
  PostScript or EPS file shows, a line at a time in the order the file
  draws it, each page ending with a form feed. TeX's placed words come out
  separated, invisible OCR text is included, and layers hidden by default
  are left out. `--json` prints JSON with each line's position in points
  from the page's top-left corner, and `--word-boxes` adds each word's;
  `-o` / `--output` writes every selected page to one file instead of
  stdout, and `--pages` and `--password` work as for rendering.
- **Assembling extracted text into words and lines**, in
  `stet_graphics::text` and re-exported by the `stet` facade (with
  `LayerSet`). `text_runs` collects a page's `TextRun`s in content order,
  skipping layers a `LayerSet` hides; `text_lines` joins them into lines —
  superscripts and changes of font stay in their line and word — and
  splits the lines into words at shown spaces and at gaps, which is how
  TeX output ("PaperTitle", drawn as two placed words) reads as "Paper
  Title". It gives the same text at both extraction levels, with line
  boxes at both and word boxes when glyphs were recorded. It is
  deliberately simple: content order is kept, and columns, tables and
  reading order are not detected.
- **`PdfDocument::set_render_annotations(bool)`**, to render pages without
  their annotations' appearances — for an application that draws
  annotations itself as editable objects, where the baked-in appearances
  would show twice. On by default; `page_annotations` still reads them.
- **`DisplayList::remove`**, to take an element out of a display list.
- **`Debug` for `DisplayList` and `DisplayElement`** (and the param structs
  that lacked it: `PatternFillParams`, `GroupParams`, `SoftMaskParams`), so
  a display list can be printed or compared as text.
- **Unicode tables for text extraction in `stet-fonts`**, the groundwork for
  extracting text from both PostScript and PDF input:
  - `stet_fonts::to_unicode::ToUnicodeMap` parses a PDF `/ToUnicode` CMap
    without losing text: surrogate pairs decode to one supplementary-plane
    character, multi-character destinations stay whole (`<00660069>` is
    `fi`, not U+FB01), and codes up to four bytes stay distinct. The PDF
    reader's rendering-side parser, which keeps one BMP code point per code
    for glyph selection, is unchanged.
  - `stet_fonts::agl::glyph_name_to_text` resolves a glyph name to text by
    the Adobe Glyph List specification's full algorithm over the complete
    AGL (4,281 names, against the 542 plus letters the renderer's table
    carries) — `a.sc` → `a`, `f_f_i` → `ffi`, `uni00660069` → `fi`,
    `u1D400` → 𝐀, `afii10017` → А — and returns nothing for names that
    carry no text, such as `g123`. `zapf_dingbats_glyph_name_to_text` does
    the same for the ZapfDingbats font (`a20` → ✔). The lists are Adobe's
    files, embedded unmodified with their BSD-3-Clause notice
    (`crates/stet-fonts/LICENSE-ADOBE-AGL`). `glyph_name_to_unicode`, which
    glyph selection uses, is unchanged.
  - `stet_fonts::cid_unicode`, the CID ↔ Unicode tables for Adobe-Japan1,
    CNS1, GB1 and Korea1, moved here from `stet-pdf-reader` so the
    PostScript interpreter can use them too, with a new `cid_to_text` that
    gives the text Adobe assigns each CID — every CID in the collection,
    including supplementary-plane characters and variation sequences.

### Changed

- **`stet_pdf_reader::content::graphics_state::PdfGraphicsState` has two new
  fields, `fill_color_source` and `stroke_color_source`,** which the reader
  uses to re-convert colours when the rendering intent changes before
  painting (see Fixed). Code that builds a `PdfGraphicsState` with a struct
  literal no longer compiles; use `PdfGraphicsState::new(ctm)` and set the
  fields you need. Reading the struct is unaffected. This is interpreter
  state that is public only because its module is; a later release will mark
  it `#[non_exhaustive]` so outside code cannot construct it directly.
- **`stet_core::glyph_cache::CachedType3Glyph` has a new field, `bbox`,**
  the glyph's `setcachedevice` box, which text extraction needs for Type 3
  fonts with an empty `FontBBox` (see "Text extraction from PostScript"
  under Added). Code that builds a `CachedType3Glyph` with a struct literal no longer compiles; add
  `bbox: None`. It is the interpreter's glyph-cache entry, public only
  because its module is, and will be marked `#[non_exhaustive]` in a later
  release like `PdfGraphicsState`.

### Deprecated

- **`stet_pdf_reader::content::cid_unicode::{cid_to_unicode,
  unicode_to_cid}`.** The tables moved to `stet_fonts::cid_unicode`; the old
  functions forward there and give the same results.
- **`stet_graphics::icc::intent_from_pdf_byte`.** It decoded the PDF
  reader's former private intent numbering, which display lists no longer
  carry. Use `stet_graphics::icc::intent_from_byte`, which decodes the
  documented encoding, and the constants in the new
  `stet_graphics::rendering_intent` module.

### Removed

- **`stet-wasm`: the `set_page_callback()` / `clear_page_callback()` JS
  exports.** These registered a callback for streaming rendered bands out of
  WASM memory. The only sink that ever invoked it, `MemorySink`, stopped
  being constructed when the browser viewer moved to on-demand viewport
  rasterization — the change that fixed a 4.6 GB OOM on a 139-page document
  at 300 DPI. Registering a callback has been a silent no-op ever since, so
  the exports and the dead sink are removed rather than left looking
  functional. Nothing in the bundled frontend called them.

### Fixed

- **An error inside a `cshow` procedure no longer changes the next glyph
  shown.** With a CID-keyed font, `cshow` hands its procedure the
  character's code and sets aside the CID it selected for a `show` inside
  the procedure to draw. A procedure that failed — caught by `stopped` —
  left that CID set aside, so the next `show` anywhere drew it in place of
  its own first glyph.
- **PostScript vertical CJK text (WMode 1) is drawn where PLRM puts it.**
  A vertical glyph's outline is drawn from its origin 0, the current point
  less its position vector v (half its width across, 880 units up by
  default); stet drew it from the current point, so every vertical glyph
  sat half a character right and most of a character high. That held for
  `show`, the `xshow` family and `charpath`. Separately, a TrueType
  CIDFont's default vertical advance and position vector — defined in
  1000-unit text space — were applied in the font's own units, so a font
  with 2048 units per em advanced less than half an em per glyph, in
  `show`, `charpath` and `stringwidth` alike. The PDF reader was already
  right.
- **A PDF form XObject whose content fails to parse part-way no longer
  corrupts the rest of the page.** An error such as an unterminated string
  inside an array made the reader return from the form before restoring
  what it had saved, so everything after it on the page drew under the
  form's transformation and resources — misplaced, or in a fallback font.
  A form with a transparency group also left its group in place of the
  page's display list and its nesting level counted, so after twenty such
  forms no further form, pattern or Type 3 glyph was drawn. The form now
  keeps what it drew before the error and the page carries on as it was.
- **Text in a PostScript CMYK transparency group no longer changes how the
  group blends.** A non-isolated `/CS /DeviceCMYK` group with Difference,
  Exclusion or a non-separable blend mode composites in CMYK when all it
  paints is CMYK. The check treated the text element that `show` records
  as non-CMYK content, so one line of text anywhere in the group switched
  the whole group to sRGB blending and changed the colour of everything in
  it. PDF input was unaffected.
- **Forms drawn with `execform` keep their transparency groups, soft masks
  and layers.** `execform` caches a form's output and replays it at each
  use, and the replay discarded groups, soft masks and layers as if only
  PDF input could produce them; stet's PostScript transparency operators
  (`begintransparencygroup`, `beginsoftmask`, `beginoptionalcontent`) make
  them too, so a form built with them drew nothing. Their bounding boxes are
  fixed in device space when they are made, which a replay from form space
  cannot correct, so such a form is now executed afresh at each use instead
  of being replayed.
- **PDF output keeps every glyph of a Type 3 font that wraps another
  font.** When a Type 3 glyph procedure draws its glyph with `show` (effect
  fonts that outline or shadow a real font do), the glyph cache replayed
  each later use of a glyph without moving the text it had recorded. PDF
  output draws that text rather than the glyph outlines, so every repeat of
  a character landed on its first occurrence: `AAAA` came out as one `A`.
  Raster output was unaffected.
- **The `stet` facade no longer leaves released objects on its stacks at the
  end of a job.** A program that ended with composite objects on the operand
  stack, dictionaries it created still on the dictionary stack, or an
  unfinished loop — all common in real PostScript — had them discarded only
  after the `restore` that released them. Release builds recovered, but in a
  debug build the dangling-reference audit panicked, so a library user's
  test suite failed on such a program. `render`, `render_to_display_list`,
  `render_to_pdf` and `exec` now discard the job's stacks first, as the CLI
  always has. The WASM viewer had the same order and is fixed too.
- **The licences of third-party material stet ships are now shipped with
  it.** The `stet`, `stet-pdf-reader` and `stet-wasm` crates embed the
  URW++ base 35 fonts, which are under the GNU AGPL v3 with a font
  exception, not stet's Apache-2.0 OR MIT; each crate now carries that
  licence as `LICENSE-URW-FONTS`. The prebuilt release archives, which
  shipped only stet's own licence files, now include
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`: the font licence, Adobe's terms for the CMap
  and glyph-list data in `stet-fonts`, and the licence of every Rust crate
  linked into that binary, generated per target by `cargo about`
  (`scripts/gen-third-party-notices.sh`). CI fails a change that adds a
  dependency under a licence not accepted in `about.toml`.
- **CJK text drawn with a substitute font picks the right glyphs.** When a
  PDF uses a CJK CID font it does not embed, the reader maps each CID to
  Unicode to find a glyph in the substitute font. The table it used was
  built by inverting Adobe's Unicode → CID CMaps, which kept an arbitrary
  one of the code points that share a CID and dropped every CID that no
  Unicode encoding reaches, or that lies outside the Basic Multilingual
  Plane. Visible effects:
  - Some common ideographs came out as the Kangxi radical sharing their CID
    (Japan1 CID 3284, 日, as ⽇ U+2F47), which substitute fonts often lack.
  - Proportional, half-width and other variant glyphs, and characters such
    as 𠮷, drew nothing — about 6,600 CIDs in Adobe-Japan1 alone.

  The tables are now generated reproducibly
  (`scripts/gen_cid_unicode_tables.py`) from Adobe's CID → Unicode CMaps
  for text and its Unicode → CID CMaps for glyph selection, with Adobe's
  BSD-3-Clause notice alongside in `crates/stet-fonts/LICENSE-ADOBE-CMAP`.
  The PDF reader's width lookup for UCS2-encoded fonts, which maps Unicode
  back to a CID, also found no CID for such characters and now does.
- **Rendering intents are no longer scrambled between the PDF reader and
  everything downstream of it.** The display list's `rendering_intent` byte
  is documented as 0=RelativeColorimetric, 1=Absolute, 2=Perceptual,
  3=Saturation, but the PDF reader wrote its own numbering (0=Perceptual,
  1=RelativeColorimetric, 2=Saturation, 3=Absolute) and the rasterizer
  decoded with the reader's. Visible effects:
  - `--device pdf` on PDF input rewrote every explicit intent as a different
    one: `/RelativeColorimetric` became `/AbsoluteColorimetric`,
    `/Saturation` became `/Perceptual`, and so on.
  - PostScript images in ICC-based colour spaces were converted with the
    wrong intent; the PostScript default, RelativeColorimetric, was applied
    as Perceptual.
  - Third-party renderers that followed `docs/DISPLAY-LIST.md` misread every
    display list built from PDF input.

  All producers and consumers now share `stet_graphics::rendering_intent`.
  `stet_pdf_reader::content::color_space::components_to_device_color_icc_with_intent`
  and `PdfGraphicsState::rendering_intent` use the same encoding.
- **The rendering intent in effect when a shape is painted now applies**, as
  the PDF specification requires, rather than the one in effect when its
  colour was set. A content stream that sets a colour and then selects an
  intent (`60 0 0 sc /Perceptual ri … f`) was converted with the earlier
  intent. Shadings painted with `sh` ignored the intent entirely, and shading
  patterns used the intent current when the pattern was selected. Only
  documents with an output intent are affected; the GWG 22.1 output-intent
  test is built this way.
- **PDF content that selects no rendering intent now uses
  RelativeColorimetric**, the initial value the PDF specification gives,
  instead of Perceptual; so does an unrecognised intent name. This changes
  rendered colour only for RGB, gray and Lab ICC-based colour in documents
  with an output intent, where stet builds a separate conversion chain per
  intent; other colour is converted as before. PDF-to-PDF rewrites no
  longer add a rendering intent the source never selected.
- **PostScript images now honour `setrenderingintent`.** Sampled images and
  rasterized shadings carried a fixed intent whatever the graphics state
  said.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-08-31

A malformed-font crash fix. Font data arrives embedded in a PDF or a
PostScript program, so it is attacker-controlled in the same way any PDF
object is, and the affected code shipped in every release to date.

### Fixed

- **A malformed CFF font no longer panics the process.** The Private DICT
  operator carries `[size, offset]`, and both were bounds-checked with
  `offset + size <= data.len()`. CFF permits a real-number operand wherever an
  integer is expected, and `f64 as usize` saturates rather than wrapping, so a
  font declaring a size of `1e49` reached that check as `usize::MAX` and
  overflowed the add before it could reject anything. **Shipped release builds
  are affected**, not only overflow-checked ones: with checks off the add wraps
  to just below the offset, the `<= data.len()` bound then *passes*, and the
  slice panics instead. Three sibling sites had the same shape: the per-FD
  Private DICT of a CID-keyed font, and both local-Subr offsets, which are
  added to their Private DICT offset. DICT operands destined for an offset or
  length are now rejected up front unless they are finite, non-negative, and
  inside what a CFF offset can address.

  Font data is attacker-controlled in the same way any PDF object is — it
  arrives embedded in a PDF or in a PostScript program — so this was reachable
  from an untrusted input. Found by the weekly fuzz job.

### Changed

- Crate descriptions and keywords across all eleven published crates now name
  what distinguishes stet — pure Rust, no C dependencies, prepress-grade CMYK
  and spot colour — rather than restating the crate name. `stet-pdf-reader`
  was previously described as "PDF parser and renderer", five words that fit
  every PDF crate on the registry.
- The `stet` facade no longer describes itself as a "PDF rendering engine". It
  depends on `stet-render` and `stet-pdf` (PDF *output*) and carries
  `stet-pdf-reader` as a dev-dependency only, so it cannot read a PDF; the old
  wording promised the one thing the crate does not do. PDF reading is
  `stet-pdf-reader`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-30

The release you can download. Every release before this one shipped source
only, so trying stet meant installing a Rust toolchain and compiling a
workspace including a GUI stack — a barrier for exactly the people most
likely to want it, who are replacing a Ghostscript call in a pipeline. This
one attaches prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows, and adds the
`-o` flag such a pipeline needs to say where output goes.

### Added

- **Prebuilt binaries on every release.** Linux (static musl and glibc+viewer),
  macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) and Windows, with a `SHA256SUMS` file.

  The **static musl build is the one most people want**: no glibc version
  requirement, no runtime libraries, no GUI, and nothing to install alongside
  it — all 56 resources are embedded in the binary. The glibc build adds the
  interactive viewer and needs glibc 2.35 or newer.

  The binaries are unsigned, and the release notes say so rather than letting
  you find out: macOS Gatekeeper quarantines browser downloads (install with
  `curl` instead), and Windows SmartScreen warns about an unknown publisher.

- **`-o` / `--output` for the CLI.** Output no longer has to land next to the
  input. The path is a *template*: a `%d` in it is replaced by the page number
  and `%0Nd` zero-pads (`p-%03d.png` gives `p-001.png`), while a path without
  a token names a single file, written exactly as given with no extension
  mangling. This is the shape `gs -sOutputFile=` uses, so an existing
  shell-out pipeline can point at stet without restructuring.

  Naming is decided by the template rather than by the page count, which is
  what makes PostScript and PDF input behave identically — a PostScript page
  count is not knowable in advance, since pages appear as `showpage` runs.
  Where Ghostscript resolves that by opening the literal path once and
  streaming every page into it (leaving several concatenated images in one
  file, exit 0, no warning), stet **stops with an error on the second page**,
  names a `%03d` form to use, and leaves page 1 intact. For PDF input the page
  count is known up front, so the same mistake is refused before anything is
  rendered.

  `-o` takes one input file, and is rejected for `--device viewer` and
  `--device null`, which write no file. `--device pdf` collects every page
  into one file, so a `%d` token there is an error rather than being ignored.
  Writing to stdout (`-o -`) is not implemented and says so.

  Default naming without `-o` is unchanged: `in-0001.png` for PostScript,
  `doc.png` / `doc-001.png` for PDF.

### Fixed

- **`stet-cli` did not build with `--no-default-features`.** The `viewer`
  feature was not genuinely optional: `render_dropped_pdf` names viewer
  channel types in its signature but carried no `#[cfg]`, so a headless build
  failed to compile even though both of its callers sit inside the
  viewer-gated `run_viewer_mode`. This is the configuration a server, CI or
  container install wants, and the one a static musl binary requires.

- **A headless build's `--help` advertised a viewer it does not have.** It
  listed `--device viewer` — which exits with "viewer not available" — and
  claimed a bare `stet` launches the viewer, when it starts the REPL. Both
  lines are now conditional on the feature.

- **A job that requested a non-zero exit status was reported as having
  completed.** `.quitwithcode 1` and the new `--output` failure both end the
  job through `quit`, which printed "completed (quit)" regardless of the code
  requested. A non-zero code now prints "FAILED". The process exit status was
  already correct.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-30

A dependency-hygiene release. A PDF-only consumer no longer compiles the
PostScript interpreter, a mesh-shading memory fault that scaled with core
count is fixed, and `--device null` works for the scripting use it is
documented for.

### Breaking

One change, affecting only consumers who already opt out of `stet-render`'s
default features. This is why the bump is minor rather than patch.

- **`stet-render` with `default-features = false` no longer provides
  `SkiaDevice` or its `OutputDevice` implementation.** They now sit behind the
  new default-on `ps-device` feature. At 0.6.0, opting out of defaults dropped
  only `parallel`; it now drops the device as well, so a consumer who declared
  `stet-render = { version = "0.6", default-features = false }` to get a
  single-threaded build will fail to compile against 0.7. Add the features you
  want by name:

  ```toml
  stet-render = { version = "0.7", default-features = false, features = ["ps-device"] }
  ```

  Nothing changes for consumers on default features, which is the overwhelming
  majority: `default = ["parallel", "ps-device"]`.

### Changed

- **`stet-pdf-reader` no longer links the PostScript interpreter.** Its
  default features pulled `stet-render`, which depended unconditionally on
  `stet-core` for a single trait, so a PDF-only consumer compiled the whole
  PostScript VM — contradicting the README's "PDF-only users don't pay for the
  VM". `stet-render` now gates `SkiaDevice` and its `OutputDevice`
  implementation behind a new default-on `ps-device` feature, and the reader
  takes the crate without it. `stet-pdf-reader`'s dependency closure is now
  `stet-fonts`, `stet-graphics`, `stet-render` and the two tiny-skia forks,
  with PDF → RGBA rendering and parallelism unchanged.

  Consumers on default features are unaffected; see Breaking above for the
  one case that is not.

### Fixed

- **`--device null` aborted PostScript programs that query the page device.**
  The flag is documented for "test / scripting use", but it installed the PLRM
  `nulldevice` *operator* rather than a page device. That resets the CTM to
  identity and leaves no page-device parameters, so `currentpagedevice
  /OutputDevice get` raised `undefined` and `initmatrix` had no device matrix
  to restore — stet's own PostScript test suite aborted partway through under
  the flag meant for running it. `--device null` now installs a real page
  device (a new `OutputDevice/null.ps` resource) that reports itself as
  `/null`, carries a page size and resolution like any other device, and still
  produces no output: nothing is rasterized and `/EndPage` never transmits a
  page. The suite now passes identically on `png`, `pdf` and `null`, and CI
  runs it on `null` as well so this cannot regress unnoticed.

- **Mesh-shaded PDFs could exhaust memory and fail to render, worse the more
  cores the machine had.** `render_patch_shading` triangulated every patch of
  a shading regardless of which band was being drawn, and bands render
  concurrently — one per thread — so the same triangle list was built once per
  core. Cost scaled with core count rather than with the file. A prepress PDF
  with a page-spanning Coons mesh at 300 dpi peaked at 2.1 GB on one thread and
  31.4 GB on sixteen, and on a 24-core machine with less than ~50 GB of RAM it
  did not render at all. Patches and triangles that cannot reach the band being
  drawn are now skipped before they are built. The same file now renders in
  0.94 s at 2.2 GB on 24 threads, and CPU time at 16 threads fell from 99.1 s
  to 5.8 s — the surplus was duplicated work, so throughput improves alongside
  memory. Rendered output is byte-identical.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-27

A hardening release. The public Rust API is strictly additive — nothing was
removed and no signature changed — but the interpreter and the PDF reader now
refuse a number of inputs they previously accepted, which is why this is a
minor bump rather than a patch.

### Breaking

Nothing here breaks compilation. Every item changes what happens to a *file*,
so audit these if you render input you do not control the shape of. All were
previously ways to abort the process, produce silently wrong output, or run
without bound; each is documented in full under Security below.

- **Numeric overflow now raises `undefinedresult`.** `1e308 1e308 mul`
  returned `inf` and `inf 0 mul` then returned `NaN`; both now error, per PLRM
  and matching Ghostscript at its own boundary. A literal `1e999` no longer
  scans as `inf` — it declines to be a number and becomes an undefined name.
  A program that relied on either value will now stop.
- **Non-finite path coordinates raise `undefinedresult`.** Reachable through a
  CTM composed past the representable range. Previously drew arbitrary output.
- **`VMerror` now halts execution.** `errordict` registered the handler under
  a name that could never match, so the interpreter printed the error and
  carried on past the failed allocation. Programs that appeared to survive an
  allocation failure will now stop at it.
- **PostScript VM is capped at 8 GiB by default** (`--max-vm`,
  `setuserparams /MaxLocalVM`). Jobs above it raise `VMerror` instead of
  growing until the OS intervenes. Separate from the renderer's image and band
  buffers, so this does not cap rendering resolution.
- **Page size is bounded at 14400 pt** (200 in) for PostScript input.
  Resolution is deliberately *not* capped — 1200 dpi at 11x17 and larger is
  ordinary prepress.
- **Image dimensions are bounded** to 100,000 per side and 4e9 pixels total,
  on both the PostScript and PDF paths, with `/BitsPerComponent` limited to
  1..=16. Sized for prepress, not for the sample corpus: a 60x40 inch page at
  1200 dpi is 3.46 Gpx and is accepted.
- **Decompressed streams are bounded** at 512 MiB, raised to whatever an image
  raster or an embedded file declares for itself. A chain of decompression
  filters no longer multiplies without limit.
- **`i64::MIN -1 idiv`** (and `mod`) raise `undefinedresult` instead of
  panicking in release.

All 691 sample PDFs render byte-identically across every change above, the
6268-file PostScript corpus has the same 31 failures with an identical failing
set, and both visual suites pass.

### Fixed

- **`stet-core` failed to compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.** The 8 GiB VM
  default is not a large `usize` on a 32-bit target but a const-evaluation
  error. The default is now computed in `u64`, falling back to `usize::MAX / 4`
  where 8 GiB does not fit.
- **`currentuserparams` reported `MaxLocalVM` as 0**, telling a program there
  was no limit moments before it hit one.

### Added

- `--timeout <SECONDS>` and `--max-vm <MB>` CLI options.
- `Context::set_timeout`, `Context::check_deadline`, `Context::check_vm_alloc`,
  `Context::vm_bytes`.
- `stet_graphics::image_limits` — `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION`, `MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`,
  `MAX_BITS_PER_COMPONENT`, and validators, shared by the PostScript and PDF
  paths so two prepress-calibrated numbers cannot drift apart.
- `stet_pdf_reader::filters::{DecodeBudget, decode_stream_bounded,
  MAX_DECODED_STREAM_BYTES}`. `decode_stream` is unchanged.
- `PdfError::NestingTooDeep`. `PdfError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so this is
  not a breaking change.
- `stet-pdf-reader`'s `parse_object_at_depth`,
  `parse_object_from_token_at_depth`, `parse_dict_body_at_depth`, and
  `MAX_OBJECT_DEPTH`. The existing depth-0 entry points are unchanged.
- `scripts/check-cli-docs.sh`, wired into CI and `.githooks/pre-push`: every
  CLI option must appear in `--help` and in both READMEs. The crates.io page
  had been listing ten of nineteen options.
- `crates/stet-cli/examples/profile_images.rs` and `profile_alloc.rs` —
  per-stage memory attribution for the render path.
- Five `cargo-fuzz` targets in `fuzz/`, with seeded corpora and a CI smoke gate.
- `[profile.hardened]` — release codegen with overflow checks left on.

### Security

Five unbounded-recursion vectors in the PDF reader let a small crafted file
abort the process with a native stack overflow. A stack overflow is not a
panic, so none of these could be contained by `catch_unwind` — any program
rendering untrusted PDFs was exposed to an uncatchable denial of service.
This is the same vulnerability class as RUSTSEC-2026-0187 in `lopdf`.

Three were depth-based, and are now capped:

- **Nested arrays and dictionaries in an object body** (`lexer.rs`).
  `parse_object_from_token` and `parse_dict_body` are mutually recursive with
  no bound, so `[[[[…` or `<</A<</A…` in any object exhausted the stack. Both
  now thread a depth counter and stop at `MAX_OBJECT_DEPTH` (256), returning
  the new `PdfError::NestingTooDeep`. The existing `parse_object`,
  `parse_object_from_token`, and `parse_dict_body` signatures are unchanged
  and enter at depth 0; `parse_object_at_depth`,
  `parse_object_from_token_at_depth`, and `parse_dict_body_at_depth` are new.
- **Nested arrays in a content stream** (`content/mod.rs`). Content-stream
  operands go through a separate parser, `parse_inline_array`, which needed
  its own cap; it shares `MAX_OBJECT_DEPTH`.
- **Nested procedures in a Type 4 (PostScript calculator) function**
  (`resources/function.rs`). `parse_token_sequence` recurses once per `{`
  body; now capped at `MAX_CALC_DEPTH` (64).

Two were cycle-based, which no depth cap alone can fix — the recursion is
infinite, so file size is irrelevant (both reproduce in under 1 KB):

- **A Type 3 stitching function that reaches itself through `/Functions`**
  (`resources/function.rs`), directly or through a ring of siblings.
  `PdfFunction::parse` now carries a set of the object numbers on the current
  path and raises `PdfError::CircularReference` on re-entry. It is a path set,
  not a seen-set — entries are popped on the way out, so the legitimate shape
  `/Functions [7 0 R 7 0 R]` still parses and renders.
- **A Type 3 CharProc that shows its own glyph** (`content/mod.rs`), directly
  or through a pair of fonts naming each other. This path incremented the
  interpreter's `depth` field but never tested it: the only check lived in
  `handle_form_xobject`. Type 3 glyphs and soft-mask groups — which likewise
  re-enter `interpret_stream` without passing through the Form XObject path —
  now check it too. The bound, `MAX_CONTENT_NESTING`, is 20, the value the
  Form XObject and pattern guards already used, so nothing that renders today
  changes.

Added `PdfError::NestingTooDeep`. `PdfError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so this
is not a breaking change.

Separately, image dictionary integers are now validated before use.

- **`/Width` and `/Height` were cast with `as u32` and then multiplied in
  `u32`.** The product overflowed: 65537 x 65536 is `2^32 + 65536`, so
  `width * height` came back as 65536 and the buffer allocated from it was far
  smaller than the loops that filled it — an "attempt to multiply with
  overflow" panic in debug builds, a silently undersized allocation in
  release. The truncating cast was wrong on its own too: `/Width 4294967297`
  became a 1-pixel image rather than an error.
- **The loop counts alone were a denial of service.** Even where the
  arithmetic survived, an 800-byte file declaring a 65537 x 65536 image spent
  9-19 seconds in release. It now completes in 0.1 s.
- Both are fixed by validating at the four points where an image dictionary is
  read (image XObject, inline image, `/SMask`, `/Mask`): dimensions must be
  positive and at most `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION` (100,000), and their product at
  most `MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS` (4,000,000,000). The ceiling is sized for prepress
  rather than for the sample corpus: a 40x28 inch press sheet at 600 dpi is
  403M pixels, an A0 poster at 600 dpi 558M, and 60x40 inch grand format at
  1200 dpi 3.46G, all of which a RIP must accept. It stays under 2^32 because
  a dozen sites compute `width * height` in `u32`; anything multiplying
  further by a component count uses saturating `usize`.
- **`/BitsPerComponent` is validated too**, to 1..=16. It reaches
  `1u32 << bpc` in `expand_bits_to_bytes`, which panics in debug builds at 32
  or more. That function now also reserves its three-way
  `width * height * components` product in `usize`, which overflows a `u32`
  sooner than the two-way one does.

Filter and font parameters are now validated the same way.

- **`/Columns`, `/Colors`, and `/BitsPerComponent` in `/DecodeParms`** were
  cast straight to `usize` and multiplied. A zero in any of them drove
  `row_bytes` to zero and reached `slice::chunks(0)` — "chunk size must be
  non-zero", which panics in **release** builds, not only debug. A negative
  became astronomical under the cast and aborted the process on a 2.3-exabyte
  reservation. Both are now range-checked with the row-size products computed
  via `checked_mul`; a malformed `/DecodeParms` leaves the stream unchanged
  rather than failing it, which is what the caller would have had if
  `/Predictor` were absent.
- **PS CIDFont header counts** (`/CIDCount`, `/SubrCount`, `/FDBytes`,
  `/GDBytes`, `/SDBytes`). `/SubrCount` was passed to `Vec::with_capacity`
  *before* the bounds check that would have rejected it, so a bogus count
  panicked with "capacity overflow" in release as well as debug. Separately,
  `FDBytes + GDBytes == 0` made the CID map size zero for any `/CIDCount`, so
  the "binary data too short" check passed and an 8 TB reservation followed
  from a 700-byte file. Counts are now bounded against the binary segment
  actually present rather than against a fixed ceiling, the byte-widths are
  capped at 8, and the reservation happens after the check.

Neither bound rejects anything real: all 691 sample PDFs were re-rendered with
the predictor fallback instrumented, and none takes it.

The font parsers in `stet-fonts` got the same treatment. Font programs arrive
embedded in both PDF and PostScript input, so these are attacker controlled in
the same way a PDF object is.

- **TrueType composite glyph recursion** — a component naming its own glyph,
  directly or through a ring, recursed until the stack was gone. Now capped at
  depth 8 with a path set of glyph ids, popped on exit so a font that
  legitimately reuses one accent twice still renders both copies. A depth cap
  alone is not sufficient here: a composite naming many components, each itself
  such a composite, repeats no id on any path, and the work is
  `fan_out ^ depth` — 64 components at depth 8 is 2.8e14 expansions from a
  400-byte glyph. A shared expansion budget (4096) bounds the total work.
- **Type 1 `seac`** re-entered through `execute()`, which restarts the
  subroutine depth counter at 0, so the existing depth-10 guard never fired on
  a `seac` naming its own glyph. The depth is now threaded through.
- **`/Subrs N`** reserved `N` entries before reading any of them;
  `/Subrs 999999999` panicked with "capacity overflow" (≈24 GB in release).
  Clamped to the bytes remaining after the marker, since each entry needs at
  least a `dup i n RD ` introducer.
- **cmap format 12** walked `for code in start..=end` over raw u32 — 4.3
  billion iterations for a full-range group — and computed
  `start_gid + (code - start_char)` as an unchecked u32 add. The span is now
  clamped to 0xFFFF (past which no glyph id can land in the 16-bit range
  anyway, so nothing mappable is lost) and the add is checked.
- **Type 2 `callsubr` / `callgsubr`** computed `idx + bias` as an unchecked
  i32 add. The number encodings top out at 32767, but Type 2 implements `add`,
  `sub`, `mul`, and `div`, so a charstring can multiply past `i32::MAX`, where
  the `as i32` cast saturates and the bias add overflows. Now `checked_add`.
- **`read_u16` / `read_i16` / `read_u32`** are now internally bounds-checked,
  returning 0 past the end of the slice. No caller changes: the ~40 call sites
  already pre-check (confirmed by probing every truncation of a synthetic font
  and 408 mutations of its offset and count fields, with zero panics), but the
  invariant was manual and unenforced.

All 691 sample PDFs render byte-identically before and after these font
changes.

Decompressed stream size is now bounded, closing a decompression-bomb vector.
`decode_stream` applied its filter chain with no ceiling on the output, so the
amplification was unbounded *and* multiplicative: a single Deflate pass tops
out near 1032:1 on a run of zeros, but a 707-byte file carrying
`/Filter [/FlateDecode /FlateDecode /FlateDecode]` measured a 2058 MB peak RSS
here, and aborted with `memory allocation of N bytes failed` — a core dump, not
a catchable error — as soon as the address space could not satisfy it. Rust
aborts on allocation failure, so like the recursion vectors above this had to
be prevented rather than handled.

- **The whole chain now shares one budget**, rather than each filter starting
  fresh, which is what stops nesting from multiplying. `FlateDecode`,
  `LZWDecode`, and `RunLengthDecode` check it from inside their decode loops —
  checking the finished buffer would mean the allocation the ceiling exists to
  prevent has already happened — and each stage's result is checked afterwards
  as well, covering the image codecs that size their own output.
- **A budget overrun is an error, never a truncation.** `decode_flate`
  recovers from a genuinely truncated stream by retrying it as raw deflate and
  keeping the longer result; without care an overrun would have taken that
  path and come back as a silently truncated success.
- **The ceiling is raised by what the stream declares about itself.** The
  general allowance, `MAX_DECODED_STREAM_BYTES`, is 512 MiB, which covers
  content streams, object and cross-reference streams, font programs, ICC
  profiles, and sampled-function tables with roughly 4x headroom over the
  largest of those. A dictionary that declares an image raster (`/Width`,
  `/Height`, `/BitsPerComponent`, `/ColorSpace`) or an attachment length
  (`/Params /Size`) gets that instead, so a 60x40 inch grand-format image at
  1200 dpi — a legitimate 13.8 GB stream — is unaffected. The declared value
  only ever raises the bound, never lowers it, so a stream that declares
  nothing, or declares something small, keeps the full general allowance.

New public API: `DecodeBudget`, `decode_stream_bounded`, and
`MAX_DECODED_STREAM_BYTES` in `stet_pdf_reader::filters`. `decode_stream` is
unchanged and now decodes under the general ceiling.

All 691 sample PDFs render byte-identically before and after this change.

The 8 GiB PostScript VM default broke the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build.
`8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024` does not fit a 32-bit `usize`, and const evaluation
rejects it outright, so `stet-core` failed to compile for that target at all —
`error[E0080]: attempt to compute 8388608_usize * 1024_usize, which would
overflow`. The default is now computed in `u64` and falls back to
`usize::MAX / 4` where 8 GiB does not fit: on a 32-bit target the whole
address space is 4 GiB, so an 8 GiB ceiling would be no ceiling at all, and a
quarter of the space leaves the rest for the renderer's buffers, the module,
and the stack. The 64-bit value is unchanged.

`VMerror` was raised under a name nothing could catch. `errordict` registered
the handler as `/VMError` while `PsError::VMError` displays as `VMerror` —
PLRM's spelling, used 35 times there, and Ghostscript's. The lookup missed, so
the interpreter printed the error and **continued past the failed
allocation**, leaving the program running as though it had succeeded. That was
harmless while the variant had no producer and became reachable the moment
`--max-vm` started raising it. Now `stopped` catches it and `$error
/errorname` reports `/VMerror`.

`currentuserparams` reported `MaxLocalVM` as 0. The ceiling can be set three
ways — the built-in default, `--max-vm`, and `setuserparams` — and only the
last writes the dict the query copied, so a program asking for the limit was
told there was none moments before hitting one. It now reports the value
actually in force.

Non-finite numbers and integer-overflow traps in the PostScript interpreter.
The backlog listed this as cosmetic — "garbage output rather than a panic" —
which was wrong in both directions: one case was a release-mode crash, and the
rest were a PLRM conformance gap rather than a cosmetic one.

- **`-9223372036854775808 -1 idiv` panicked in release.** `i64::MIN / -1` is
  the one pair that overflows, and integer division overflow is a trap in
  Rust's semantics rather than something `overflow-checks` enables, so this
  aborted an optimised build from 30 bytes of PostScript. `idiv` and `mod` now
  use `checked_div` / `checked_rem` and raise `undefinedresult`.
- **Real overflow produced `inf` instead of an error.** PLRM: "A numeric
  computation would produce a meaningless result or one that cannot be
  represented as a number. Possible causes include numeric overflow or
  underflow, division by 0…" — and every arithmetic operator that can return a
  real lists `undefinedresult` among its errors. `1e308 1e308 mul` yielded
  `inf`, and `inf 0 mul` then yielded `NaN`. `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, and
  `exp` now raise `undefinedresult` when the result is not finite, matching
  Ghostscript, which does the same at its own (single-precision) boundary.
  stet's boundary is `f64`'s, as with the `i64` integer width: PLRM Appendix B
  lists real limits under "Typical Limits" as properties of the host
  architecture, not as conformance requirements.
- **A literal `1e999` scanned straight to `inf`**, introducing a non-finite
  value with no arithmetic at all — `"1e999".parse::<f64>()` succeeds. The
  scanner now declines such a token, which falls through to the name scanner
  exactly as `1e999x` already did, so a program using one gets `undefined`
  rather than a value. Ghostscript raises `limitcheck` here and stet
  deliberately does not: that was tried first and it broke a 35 MB corpus file
  that renders correctly, whose hex image data contains byte runs such as
  `5657564e574` — syntactically a real with a 580-digit exponent, scanned and
  discarded harmlessly as a name.
- **Path construction rejects non-finite device coordinates.** With the two
  sources above closed, a `NaN` could still arrive through a CTM composed past
  the representable range (`1e300 1e300 scale` twice). `moveto`, `rmoveto`,
  `lineto`, `rlineto`, `curveto`, `rcurveto`, `arc`, `arcn`, `arcto`, and
  `arct` now raise `undefinedresult` instead, which is the error PLRM assigns
  to graphics operators under an unusable CTM. The check is on the path rather
  than on the matrix operators because composing a wild CTM is not itself an
  error — a program may `scale` extravagantly, draw nothing, and `grestore`.
  This also closes a latent hang: `arc` normalises with
  `while stop < start { stop += 360.0 }`, which never terminates for a `stop`
  of negative infinity.

A `NaN` reaching geometry never crashed — it makes every comparison against it
false, so bounds, banding, and winding quietly take the wrong branch. Silent
wrong output was the real exposure.

All 691 sample PDFs render byte-identically. The 6268-file PostScript corpus
has the same 31 failures before and after, with no file newly failing; all 86
`ps_samples` and the `unit_tests/` suite pass unchanged.

### Added

- **A ceiling on PostScript VM**, via `Context::max_local_vm`,
  `setuserparams /MaxLocalVM`, and the CLI's `--max-vm <MB>`. Exceeding it
  raises `PsError::VMError`, which previously had no producer.
  **The default is 8 GiB rather than unlimited**: a failed allocation aborts
  the process, so there is no error to catch afterwards and an opt-in limit
  would leave the abort reachable by default. `500000000 array` requested
  16 GB and took stet down; it now raises `VMerror`. This bounds PostScript VM
  — strings, arrays, dictionaries — which is a separate pool from the
  renderer's band and image buffers.

  The check measures reserved capacity rather than length, and bounds what may
  be *requested* rather than what is held: the arena stores grow geometrically,
  so one sitting at capacity asks the allocator for roughly twice that. Steady
  growth therefore stops at about half the nominal ceiling; a single large
  request is bounded by the full one. It also counts global VM, unlike PLRM's
  local-only `MaxLocalVM`, since a local-only ceiling is sidestepped with
  `true setglobal`.

- **`--timeout <SECONDS>`** and `Context::set_timeout` — a wall-clock deadline
  for interpretation, raising `PsError::Timeout`. PostScript is
  Turing-complete, so nothing static bounds how long a program runs, and a
  deadline is the only thing that stops one which makes progress but never
  terminates. **There is no limit by default**, preserving existing REPL and
  CLI behaviour; set one when the input is untrusted. The check counts down a
  `u32` and consults the clock every 4096 iterations, and short-circuits when
  no deadline is set, so the default path measures as free (-0.42% on a tight
  4M-iteration arithmetic loop).

### Added

- **Fuzzing (`fuzz/`)** — five `cargo-fuzz` targets covering the parsers that
  consume untrusted input: `fuzz_pdf_parse` (open + render + the structural
  API), `fuzz_font_truetype`, `fuzz_font_cff`, `fuzz_font_type1`, and
  `fuzz_ps_tokenizer`. `fuzz/seed-corpus.sh` seeds them from the in-tree
  samples (703 PDFs, 6410 PostScript inputs, 35 Type 1 faces) and
  `fuzz/run.sh` runs them with settings suited to a sanitizer build. The crate
  is excluded from the workspace, like `stet-wasm`, because cargo-fuzz needs
  nightly and stet is stable-only with a pinned MSRV. A weekly scheduled
  workflow (`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`) runs 300s per target; it is not on
  the push path, where it gated nothing and dominated the run. See
  `fuzz/README.md`.

### Added

- **`[profile.hardened]`** — release codegen with `overflow-checks` and
  `debug-assertions` left on, for finding silent arithmetic wraps at release
  speed. Build with `cargo build --profile hardened`. It is a testing profile,
  not a shipping one: published binaries stay on `release`, since a trapped
  overflow is a panic and that is not what a renderer should do to a user over
  a malformed file. Gated in CI by a new `Overflow checks` job. The vendored
  `stet-tiny-skia` forks are excluded per-package — their SIMD-lane emulation
  is modular arithmetic by definition, matching the hardware instructions the
  aarch64 paths use.

### Fixed

- **The PostScript `image`, `imagemask`, and `colorimage` operators had no
  upper bound on their dimensions.** Only the lower bound was checked, so
  sixty bytes of PostScript could request a 4 x 10^18 byte allocation, which
  aborts the process rather than failing catchably. All three now validate
  against the shared prepress-scale limits: a non-positive dimension raises
  `rangecheck` and one past the ceiling raises `limitcheck`, per PLRM.
  A 24000 x 16800 press sheet (403M pixels) still draws normally.
- **Image size limits moved to `stet_graphics::image_limits`,** shared by the
  PostScript operators and the PDF image handler. The two crates cannot see
  each other, and duplicating a prepress-calibrated ceiling would let the two
  copies drift.
- **`setpagedevice` with a degenerate `/PageSize` panicked the renderer.**
  `<< /PageSize [-1 -1] >>` reached `Pixmap::new(0, 0)`, which returns `None`,
  through an `.expect()`. The allocation is now non-panicking, and
  `setpagedevice` clamps a file-declared page to 14400 pt per side (200 in,
  the Adobe PDF 1.7 `/MediaBox` implementation limit), falling back to US
  Letter for a non-finite or non-positive value. **Render resolution is
  deliberately not capped** — pixel dimensions are `points * dpi / 72`, and
  while the points come from the file, the DPI is the caller's explicit
  request; a 1200 dpi proof of a large-format page is a legitimate gigapixel
  render.
- **Two native-stack recursion vectors in the interpreter.** A `/Separation`
  colour space whose tint transform sets that same colour space re-entered
  `exec_sync` without bound — about 200 bytes of PostScript aborted the
  process. `exec_sync` is now capped at depth 100 via `Context::exec_sync_depth`,
  raising `PsError::ExecStackOverflow`. Separately, `parse_procedure` and
  `stream_parse_procedure` had no `{`-nesting cap, so 200000 nested braces
  (a 400 KB file) aborted; both now stop at `MAX_PROC_DEPTH` (100), matching
  the existing `MAX_BOS_DEPTH`.
- **Four unchecked `u16` range ends in the CFF parser** (charset formats 1 and
  2, CID-map formats 1 and 2). `for sid in first..=first + n_left` overflows
  when a range starts near 0xFFFF — a panic under overflow checks, a wrapped
  range otherwise. Found by `cargo fuzz` within 60s of a cold start. The same
  pass fixed `n_glyphs - 1` in both format 0 readers, which underflows `usize`
  for a font declaring zero glyphs.

- **Octal escapes in PDF literal strings** (`\ddd`) accumulated into a `u8`,
  so a three-digit escape above `\377` overflowed the accumulator. The
  rendered byte was already correct — PDF 32000-1 7.3.4.2 specifies that
  high-order overflow is ignored, which is what the release build's silent
  wrap produced — but the arithmetic was wrong and panicked under overflow
  checks. Found by sweeping the sample corpus under the new `hardened`
  profile (`pdf_samples/142.pdf`).
- Shading color-stop sampling now sorts with `f64::total_cmp` instead of
  `partial_cmp().unwrap()`, and clamps its own sample count so the divisor in
  `i / (n - 1)` cannot be zero. No crafted file was found that reaches either
  path — the discontinuity filter excludes NaN and callers already clamp the
  count — so this is hardening against a future caller, not a live fix.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-25

Minor release. PostScript integers are now 64-bit, which fixes the standard
LCG idiom that programs use for pseudo-randomness and is the reason this is a
breaking release rather than a patch. Three Type 3 font defects and a
`clippath` coordinate-space bug are also fixed, and the CLI gains `--page`.

### Breaking

Downstream Rust code that reads PostScript integers needs attention; nothing
in the PostScript language surface changed incompatibly.

- **`PsValue::Int` now carries `i64` instead of `i32`.** A
  `match obj.value { PsValue::Int(v) => … }` binds an `i64`, so any use site
  that needs an `i32` no longer compiles. `DictKey::Int` and `Token::Int`
  widened with it, as did `Context::rand_seed`.
- **`PsObject::as_i32()` now range-checks.** It returns `None` for a value
  outside `i32`, where before it always returned `Some` for an integer. This
  is the one change with no compiler error behind it — audit call sites that
  treat `None` as "not an integer". Use the new `as_i64()` for the full
  range; keep `as_i32()` where the value is genuinely bounded (array and
  string indices, character codes), since a too-large value should fail those
  callers' range checks rather than wrap into a valid-looking index.
- **`PsObject::int()` takes `impl Into<i64>`.** Calls are unaffected; only
  code coercing it to a `fn(i32) -> PsObject` pointer breaks.

### Fixed

- **Type 3 fonts supplying only `BuildGlyph` raised `invalidfont`.** The show
  path required `BuildChar` unconditionally and pushed the character code.
  PLRM 5.7 lists `BuildGlyph` as preferred and makes `BuildChar` required only
  "for LanguageLevel 1 or if `BuildGlyph` is absent", so such a font is
  well-formed and must be handed the character *name* from `Encoding`.
  Ghostscript renders these; stet refused them. `xshow`/`yshow`/`xyshow` had
  the identical defect.
- **`stringwidth` raised `invalidfont` on every Type 3 font**, `BuildChar`
  ones included. It branched for font types 2, 0 and 42 and then fell through
  to the Type 1 path, which looks for `CharStrings` — a Type 3 font has none.
  There is no width table to consult: the width is whatever the build
  procedure hands `setcachedevice`/`setcharwidth`, so the procedure now runs
  inside a `gsave`/`grestore` with its marks drained, and measuring paints
  nothing.
- **`glyphshow` raised `invalidfont` on every Type 3 font.** It read
  `FontType` but never branched on 3, going straight to the `CharStrings`
  lookup. Per the PLRM it now invokes `BuildGlyph` with the name directly —
  bypassing `Encoding`, which is what lets `glyphshow` reach glyphs no
  character code maps to — or, with only `BuildChar`, reverse-searches
  `Encoding` for the name and pushes the array index, retrying with
  `/.notdef` and raising `invalidfont` only when neither is encoded.
- **PostScript integers are now 64-bit**, matching Ghostscript, which fixes the
  standard LCG idiom PostScript programs use for pseudo-randomness:
  `/seed seed 1103515245 mul 12345 add 2147483648 mod def`. On 32-bit integers
  the product overflowed, promoted to a real, and `mod` — which is
  integer-only — raised `typecheck`. Widening only the real fallback would not
  have fixed it: the product needs 55 bits and a real carries 53, so the seed
  would have come out one too high and every later draw would have diverged
  silently from what other interpreters produce. PLRM Appendix B's 32-bit
  range is listed under "Typical Limits" for interpreters "running on 32-bit
  machines" which "do not necessarily apply to all PostScript
  implementations", so this is not a conformance change. Overflow past the
  64-bit range still promotes to a real. `bitshift` is correspondingly 64-bit
  wide, and `cvi` accepts the wider range.
- **`clippath` returned the page in device space instead of current user
  space**, so a program that had transformed its coordinate system got a clip
  rectangle dragged along with the transform. The `clippath fill` idiom for
  painting a background then filled an offset region and left part of the page
  bare — visible in the tiger EPS, whose grey backdrop was displaced by its
  `%%BoundingBox` origin. The default clip is a fixed region of the device, so
  it is now derived with the default CTM; `pathbbox` and `fill` map it back
  through the current CTM, which is what puts it in user space for the caller.
  Ghostscript's values now match exactly under translate, scale and rotate.
- **`cvi` on a long integer-valued string was off by one.** The string scanner
  returned `f64`, so `(22358003463039195) cvi` came back as `...196` after the
  round trip through a 53-bit mantissa. Integer literals now stay integral.

### Added

- **The CLI reports a page that was painted but never shown.** A program that
  paints marks and then ends without a matching `showpage` leaves them on a
  page the device is never asked to emit, and the page is discarded. That is
  correct — it is what the PLRM specifies and what Ghostscript's file devices
  do — but it was indistinguishable from a broken renderer: no file appeared
  and nothing said why. The warning distinguishes a program that produced no
  output at all from one that lost only its trailing page.
- **`Interpreter::warnings()`** surfaces the same diagnostic to library
  callers, where the silence was worse: `render()` returned `Ok(vec![])`, an
  empty page list that reads as a legitimate result. New public types
  `ExecWarning` and `ExecWarningKind` in `stet::diagnostics`; the CLI shares
  the detector, so the two cannot drift. Programs that install `nulldevice`
  are exempt — that is the PLRM-sanctioned way to ask for no output, so marks
  left unemitted are the point rather than a mistake.
- **`--page` sets the page size for PostScript/EPS input** — a named size
  (`letter`, `legal`, `tabloid`, `ledger`, `executive`, `a0`-`a6`, `b4`, `b5`)
  or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` in points, with an optional `-landscape` / `-portrait`
  suffix that swaps the dimensions. There was previously no way to render a
  plain `%!PS` program whose artwork is larger than the default page:
  `%%BoundingBox` sets the page only for EPS — for a non-EPS document DSC
  makes it a description of the artwork's extent, not a page-size request, so
  both stet and Ghostscript fall back to US Letter and clip. `--page`
  overrides an EPS `%%BoundingBox` when both apply, and is rejected for PDF
  input, whose pages carry their own size.
- `GlyphCache::by_type3_name`, a name-keyed Type 3 glyph cache. `glyphshow`
  can name a glyph that no character code maps to, which leaves nothing for
  the existing code-keyed cache to key on.

### WebAssembly

- **`stet-wasm` 0.2.0.** Its JavaScript API is unchanged, but the browser
  build inherits everything above, so rendering output moves: `clippath`
  backgrounds fill the page, Type 3 fonts that previously raised
  `invalidfont` render, and PostScript programs using the standard LCG for
  pseudo-randomness run instead of failing. A minor rather than a patch
  because the pixels change, not because anything you call does.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-15

Patch release. Two `currentsystemparams` values were wrong in every release
up to and including 0.4.0, and PDFs now record which build wrote them. No API
changes; no rendering changes.

### Fixed

- **`/PrinterName` returned `(stetIE)` instead of `(stet)`.** The string was
  allocated with the four bytes of `stet` but declared six bytes long, so
  reading it ran two bytes into the next allocation — which happened to be
  `/RealFormat`. Not memory-unsafe (the arena is a single buffer), but it put
  a neighbouring allocation's bytes into a value any PostScript program can
  read, and the value would have changed as soon as allocation order did.
- **`/RealFormat` returned `(IEE)` instead of `(IEEE)`** — a missing `E` in
  the literal, independent of the overrun above. The PLRM specifies this key
  as naming the internal real representation, and Ghostscript reports
  `(IEEE)`.

  Both lengths are now derived from the literal rather than written out
  twice, which is what allowed them to disagree. The other three
  allocate-then-declare sites in `Context::new` were audited and are correct.
  Regression coverage in `unit_tests/interpreter_param_tests.ps` asserts
  lengths as well as contents — the contents alone read plausibly, and it was
  the overrun that made them wrong.

### Changed

- **PDF `/Producer` now carries the version**, e.g. `stet 0.4.1`, where it
  previously wrote a bare `stet`. Every other producer does this —
  Ghostscript writes `GPL Ghostscript 10.05.1`, Distiller
  `Acrobat Distiller 20.0` — and it is the first thing checked when a
  prepress shop is chasing a rendering difference between two files. A
  `pdfmark` `/DOCINFO /Producer` override still takes precedence; this
  changes only the default. Note that this alters bytes in the `/Info` dict
  of every PDF stet writes, at every release.
- **Documented MSRV corrected to Rust 1.88.** The README badge had claimed
  1.85 since it was added — a number inferred from `edition = "2024"` and
  never compiled against. The real floor is 1.88: first-party code uses
  let-chains in 282 places across nine crates, `jpeg-encoder` declares 1.87,
  and `fearless_simd` declares 1.86. Nothing about what stet requires has
  changed; only the claim is now true. `rust-version = "1.88"` is declared in
  `[workspace.package]` and inherited by all eleven first-party crates, so
  cargo now reports a clear "requires rustc 1.88" instead of failing with a
  confusing edition parse error on an older toolchain.
- A pinned `MSRV 1.88` CI job builds the workspace on exactly that toolchain
  on every push, and `scripts/check-release-versions.sh` now ties the README
  badge, the README prose, and the CI job's pin to `rust-version` so the four
  cannot drift apart. The script also asserts every publishable crate
  declares an MSRV, so none can reach crates.io without one.
- **Switched to `resolver = "3"`** (MSRV-aware dependency resolution). Cargo
  now prefers dependency versions compatible with the declared
  `rust-version` rather than always taking the newest, so a routine
  `cargo update` can no longer silently break the floor. The lockfile was
  byte-identical on adoption, but this is already doing work: it holds back
  `hayro-jpeg2000` 0.4.0 (needs 1.92) and `moxcms` 0.9.0 (needs 1.89).

### Note for downstream users

Releases up to and including 0.4.0 published with no `rust-version` in their
manifests, so crates.io and docs.rs show no MSRV for them and cargo cannot
warn an old toolchain before it fails to compile. Published versions are
immutable; this release is the first to carry the metadata.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-14

Minor release focused on **memory and PostScript conformance**. `restore`
now reclaims local VM instead of only reverting values, several
long-standing PLRM 3.7.2/3.7.3 violations in the interpreter's own writes
are fixed, and a 6384-file PostScript corpus sweep drove the job-abort
count from 1158 to 147 — of which 116 fail identically in Ghostscript,
leaving 31 that are genuinely ours.

This is a `0.x` minor bump. No public API was removed; `Context` gained
fields, which is source-breaking only for code constructing one
literally (it has no public constructor other than `Context::new`).

### Highlights

- **`restore` reclaims local VM.** Allocations made above a `save`'s
  high-water mark are released rather than left resident. A
  save/restore loop that peaked at 2108 MB now peaks at 74 MB.
- **`restore` actually reverts what it is supposed to.** Several
  interpreter-internal writes bypassed copy-on-write, so `restore` had
  no backup to revert to: `defineresource`, `FontDirectory`, `reverse`,
  `execstack` and `dictstack`. This was a live PLRM 3.7.3 violation, not
  a theoretical one.
- **Global/local VM enforcement is no longer silently disabled.**
  `.error` did not restore `setglobal`, so any caught error left the
  interpreter in whatever VM mode the failing code had set.
- **Eleven interpreter defects found by a 6384-file corpus sweep**, each
  A/B'd against the previous sweep with no regressions: procedure data
  sources, the Pattern colour space, `bind` on nested procedures,
  array-form colour spaces, `cvi`/`cvr` string conversion, CIDFontType 0
  `StartData`, 16-bit image samples, EOI-less JPEG, `shareddict`/`scheck`,
  self-registering resource files, `rectclip`, `cshow`, and `charpath` on
  Type 3 fonts.

### Added

- `charpath` support for Type 3 fonts: the glyph procedure runs without
  marking the page and the paths it would have painted become part of
  the current path.
- The `Pattern` colour space — `setcolorspace`/`setcolor`/`currentcolor`
  with a pattern, including the uncoloured (PaintType 2) base-space form.
- `shareddict` and `scheck` in `systemdict`.
- 16 bits per component for `image` / `imagemask` / `colorimage`.
- `stet_core::vm_audit` and `--example audit_vm`: a machine check for
  dangling references and PLRM 3.7.2 global/local violations.
- PostScript corpus build and sweep tooling under `scripts/`.

### Fixed

- `restore` now releases local VM allocated above the save mark, and
  copy-on-writes the dictionaries and arrays it is required to revert.
- Every allocation is stamped with its save level and VM mode, so
  `restore` can tell a surviving reference from a dangling one and raise
  `invalidrestore` when PLRM requires it.
- `.error` restores the VM allocation mode; page-device arrays are
  allocated in the page device's own VM and deep-copied on promotion.
- `filter` accepts procedure data sources everywhere, runs them when the
  data is read rather than at `filter` time, and honours SubFileDecode's
  EOD semantics.
- `bind` marks nested procedures read-only per PLRM, and terminates on
  cyclic procedure graphs.
- `setcolorspace` accepts array-form base and alternate colour spaces.
- `cvi` and `cvr` convert strings through the scanner, as PLRM specifies.
- `CIDInit`'s `StartData` consumes its charstring blob instead of
  leaving it to be scanned as tokens.
- DCTDecode accepts a JPEG stream that ends before its EOI marker.
- Resource files that register themselves are loaded once, through a
  shared `.LoadResource`, so `composefont` can find a CMap on disk.
- `rectclip` takes every rectangle in a multi-rectangle argument, and
  accepts an empty array.
- `cshow` hands its procedure the character code, not the CID.
- CIE decode tables are memoised, and 8-bit image samples are no longer
  copied in `unpack_samples` — together these took the corpus from 24
  out-of-memory jobs to none.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-12

Minor release adding **PDF→PDF round-trip** through the PDF output
device. A PDF parsed by `stet-pdf-reader` into the display list can now
be re-emitted as PDF with its prepress semantics preserved — spot
(Separation/DeviceN) colors, ICCBased spaces, overprint, soft masks,
transparency groups, optional-content layers, and `/OutputIntents` all
survive the round-trip rather than collapsing to flat process color.

This is a `0.x` minor bump. The document-structure IR moved from
`stet-core` into `stet-graphics` (still re-exported by `stet-core`), so
code that reaches those types through `stet-core` is unaffected.

### Highlights

- **PDF→PDF round-trip** — `--device pdf` on a PDF input now routes
  through `PdfDocument` → `PdfDevice`, so a PDF can be read to the
  display list and written back out as PDF (previously only PS/EPS
  input reached `PdfDevice`).
- **Prepress color preserved** — Separation/DeviceN spot colors (and
  their base spaces, with DeviceGray promotion), ICCBased fill/stroke
  spaces, and ICCBased bases inside Indexed image spaces all round-trip;
  `/Catalog /OutputIntents` is carried through so the CMYK-driving ICC
  profile is retained.
- **Overprint preserved** — `/OP`/`/op` forced on the first paint of
  each content stream, `/OPM` carried through the display list, and
  overprint state emitted for Image and Shading paints.
- **Transparency & layers emitted from the display list** —
  `DisplayElement::Group` as a Form XObject, `SoftMasked` with per-paint
  alpha/blend, and `DisplayElement::OcgGroup` with `/OCProperties`
  optional-content groups.

### Added

- PDF output: Separation/DeviceN spot color + base round-trip,
  Separation/DeviceN shadings and spot imagemasks, and CMYK imagemask
  fill preservation.
- PDF output: ICCBased fill/stroke color-space round-trip and ICCBased
  base preservation inside Indexed image color spaces.
- PDF output: `/Catalog /OutputIntents` round-trip through PDF→PDF.
- PDF output: `Group` → Form XObject, `SoftMasked` + per-paint
  alpha/blend, `OcgGroup` → `/OCProperties`, per-paint alpha on the
  Image and Shading writer arms, overprint state on Image/Shading, and
  `/OPM` round-trip.

### Changed

- Document-structure IR lifted from `stet-core` into `stet-graphics`
  (re-exported by `stet-core`).
- PDF writer: graphics-state tracker restored across `q`/`Q`
  boundaries; replayed clips collapsed so a round-trip no longer grows
  the display list; implicit page-box clip skipped on PDF→PDF.
- `stet-pdf-reader`: spot tint-transform table cached per content
  stream.
- README: added a Commercial Support section.

### Fixed

- Removed a dead `emit_fill_color_rgb` helper, superseded by the
  DeviceColor-aware imagemask fill path (cleared a `dead_code` warning).

### Crates published at 0.3.0

`stet`, `stet-cli`, `stet-fonts`, `stet-graphics`, `stet-core`,
`stet-ops`, `stet-engine`, `stet-render`, `stet-viewer`,
`stet-pdf-reader`, `stet-pdf`. The vendored `stet-tiny-skia` /
`stet-tiny-skia-path` forks remain at `0.11.4`. `stet-wasm` remains at
`0.1.1` (excluded from crates.io, independent cadence).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-09

Patch release focused on PDF/X CMYK rendering correctness against the
[Ghent PDF Output Suite](https://gwg.org/pdf-output-suite/) (GWG)
test corpus. Fixes a family of bugs where ICCBased / Lab / DeviceN
fills, images, and transparency groups didn't round-trip through the
document's `/OutputIntents` profile correctly, producing visible "X"
markers in calibration swatches that should render uniform.

This is an **additive, non-breaking** release. Cargo will auto-bump
`stet = "0.2"` to `0.2.1`; downstream code does not need to change.
New public API on `stet-graphics::IccCache` and a new
`rendering_intent: u8` field on `stet-graphics::ImageParams` are
documented under "Added" below.

### Highlights

- **GWG 13.3** — ICCBased RGB paints with `/OP true` no longer route
  into the custom-spot overprint path; per PDF 1.7 §11.7.4.5 they
  paint as if `/OP` were false.
- **GWG 16.1** — per-intent PDF/X proofing chain (`source A2B → PCS
  → OI B2A → CMYK`) is built for every registered ICCBased RGB
  profile, threaded through `op_ri` / ExtGState `/RI`.
- **GWG 16.4** — transparency groups with no `/CS` (inherit) now
  resolve correctly to the parent's CMYK compositing space when
  the parent is a `/CS DeviceCMYK` group.
- **GWG 17.2** — ICCBased images now go through the proofing chain
  via `convert_image_8bit_with_intent` (was bypassing the
  OutputIntent roundtrip and rendering via direct source→sRGB).
- **GWG 22.1** — Lab fills populate `DeviceColor::native_cmyk` via a
  direct `Lab → PCS → OI B2A → CMYK` chain (matches Adobe ACE),
  and the OutputIntent install path pre-warms the sRGB→CMYK
  reverse transform so the parallel CMYK buffer never falls back
  to the PLRM `(1−r, 1−g, 1−b, 0)` formula.
- **WASM viewer** — `open_pdf` now applies the document's
  OutputIntent before storing the cached state, so PDF/X documents
  render in the browser the same way they do in the CLI.

### Added — public API (additive, non-breaking)

`stet-graphics`:

- `IccCache::convert_to_oi_cmyk(hash, components, intent)` — run an
  RGB ICC color through the proofing chain at the given intent and
  return the intermediate OutputIntent CMYK.
- `IccCache::convert_lab_to_oi_cmyk(l, a, b, intent)` — direct
  `Lab → OI CMYK` via the OI's per-intent B2A LUT.
- `IccCache::convert_image_8bit_with_intent(hash, samples,
  pixel_count, intent)` — bulk image conversion with explicit
  rendering intent.
- `IccCache::convert_color_with_intent` and
  `convert_color_readonly_with_intent` — per-intent single-color
  conversion.
- `IccCache::prepare_lab_to_oi_cmyk()` — pre-build per-intent
  Lab→OI samplers; pair with `prepare_reverse_cmyk()`.
- `IccCache::intent_from_pdf_byte(b: u8)` — map PDF rendering-intent
  bytes (`0..3`) to `IccRenderingIntent`.
- `pub use moxcms::RenderingIntent as IccRenderingIntent`.
- `pub struct LabToCmykSampler` (in `icc::perceptual`) with
  `pub fn sample_pdf_lab(l, a, b)`.
- New field `ImageParams::rendering_intent: u8`. Default is `0`
  (Perceptual). Per the documented "be a reader, not a writer"
  policy for param structs (CLAUDE.md), this is additive and not
  treated as a SemVer break.

`stet-pdf-reader`:

- `PdfDocument::apply_output_intent_as_default_cmyk()` now also
  pre-warms the sRGB→CMYK reverse and per-intent Lab→OI samplers
  in addition to its previous behaviour. No signature change.
- Image XObjects with `/Intent` now propagate the per-image
  rendering intent into `ImageParams.rendering_intent`, overriding
  the gstate `/RI` per ISO 32000 §11.3.4.

`stet-render`:

- `build_icc_cache_for_list` now also pre-warms the per-intent
  Lab→OI samplers when proofing is enabled.

### Fixed

- DeviceGray painted in a PDF/X DeviceCMYK page group now routes
  through the K plate (matches DeviceCMYK 0/0/0/(1−g) byte-for-byte).
- DeviceN images with a non-CMYK alternate space go through the
  overprint path so process plates aren't disturbed.
- Paired `/OP true /op true` ExtGStates are now treated as a
  "strict overprint" signal (matches Adobe Illustrator's emit).
- The custom-spot overprint dispatch and the parallel CMYK buffer's
  `is_custom_spot` heuristic both now require
  `process_cmyk.is_some()` so proofing-chain ICCBased RGB stays out.

### Crates published at 0.2.1

`stet`, `stet-cli`, `stet-fonts`, `stet-graphics`, `stet-core`,
`stet-ops`, `stet-engine`, `stet-render`, `stet-viewer`,
`stet-pdf-reader`, `stet-pdf`. The vendored `stet-tiny-skia` /
`stet-tiny-skia-path` forks remain at `0.11.4`. `stet-wasm` is
excluded from crates.io and bumped to `0.1.1` independently.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-01

This release lands a substantial expansion of the `stet-pdf-reader`
structural API, the PDF imaging-extension operators (transparency,
soft masks, optional content), and the `pdfmark` PostScript-to-PDF
authoring bridge. Several public match-surface enums are now
`#[non_exhaustive]` to lock in additive evolution — the breaking
changes are deliberate and documented per-crate below.

### ⚠ Breaking changes

This is a **breaking release**. Cargo treats the `0.1 → 0.2` bump as
incompatible (per the SemVer rules for `0.x`), so existing users
pinned at `stet = "0.1"` won't be auto-upgraded.

The breaking surface is concentrated in two places:

1. **`#[non_exhaustive]` markers** were added to ~40 public
   match-surface enums across `stet-graphics`, `stet-core`, and
   `stet-pdf-reader`. Any downstream `match` over `DisplayElement`,
   `PsError`, `Destination`, `AnnotationKind`, the various pdfmark
   record enums, etc. now requires a `_ => { ... }` wildcard arm.
   See the "Changed — public API breaking changes" subsection below
   for the complete list.

2. **`stet-pdf` no longer emits PDF/X-3 OutputIntents.** PDF output
   is now plain PDF 1.7. `PdfDevice::set_output_profile()` is
   `#[deprecated]` as a no-op; existing call sites compile but stop
   producing the (previously broken) PDF/X-3 conformance label.

For a typical downstream renderer that pattern-matches on
`DisplayElement`, the migration is one wildcard arm per `match`
site:

```diff
 match element {
     DisplayElement::Fill { .. } => { /* … */ }
     DisplayElement::Stroke { .. } => { /* … */ }
     DisplayElement::Image { .. } => { /* … */ }
+    _ => { /* fall through; new variants in 0.2.x are additive */ }
 }
```

The `#[non_exhaustive]` ratchet is intentional: it makes future
variant additions non-breaking, so 0.2.x → 0.3.x will be smaller.

### Added — `stet-pdf-reader` structural API

A read-only structural-content API for PDF inspection and tooling.
Every accessor parses lazily on first call and caches its result.

- `metadata()` — `/Info` dict (title, author, dates, …) and the
  catalog's `/Metadata` XMP stream.
- `viewer_preferences()` — page layout, page mode, print preferences,
  and reading direction hints.
- `outline()` — bookmark tree as `OutlineItem`s with
  destination/action resolution.
- `destinations()`, `resolve_named_destination(name)` — named
  destination table merged from `/Catalog /Dests` (legacy) and the
  `/Names /Dests` name tree.
- `page_annotations(page)` — typed `Annotation` list with
  destination/action resolution.
- `form()`, `form_fields()` — AcroForm field tree (text, choice,
  button, signature) with widget cross-references.
- `page_boxes(page)` — MediaBox / CropBox / BleedBox / TrimBox /
  ArtBox.
- `embedded_files()`, `embedded_file_bytes(name)` — `/EmbeddedFiles`
  name-tree walker.
- `layers()`, `layer(ocg_id)`, `configurations()`,
  `default_configuration()`, `layer_tree()`, `layer_set_for(intent)`
  — Optional Content Group (OCG) metadata, hierarchy, render-intent
  rules, and a runtime `LayerSet` for visibility overrides.
- `parse_warnings()` — diagnostic sink for non-fatal parse issues
  (broken outlines, bad name trees, malformed `/VE` expressions, …).
- New `stet inspect <file.pdf>` CLI subcommand surfaces the structural
  API at the command line.

See `docs/PDF-READER-API.md` and `docs/PDF-LAYERS.md` for full
references.

### Added — PDF imaging extensions

Display-list-level support for the PDF transparency and optional-content
imaging models, layered on top of the PostScript interpreter.

- **Alpha and blend modes**: `setblendmode`, `setfillalpha`,
  `setstrokealpha`, `setalphaisshape`. All 16 PDF blend modes.
- **Transparency groups**: `begintransparencygroup` /
  `endtransparencygroup` with `Knockout`, `Isolated`, and group
  colour space (`DeviceGray` / `DeviceRGB` / `DeviceCMYK` / ICC).
- **Soft masks**: `begintransparencymaskgroup` /
  `endtransparencymaskgroup` with `Alpha` and `Luminosity` subtypes,
  transfer functions, and backdrop-colour handling.
- **Optional Content (OCG)**: `setocg` / `endocg` operators wrap
  display-list content in `OcgGroup` elements with
  `OcgVisibility::Single` / `Membership` / `Expression` predicates.
  `LayerSet` (in `stet-graphics`) is the consumer's per-render override
  map; `render_page_to_rgba_with_layers` honours it.
- **Filters**: `JBIG2Decode` and `JPXDecode` for embedded image
  streams.

See `docs/PDF-EXTENSIONS.md` for the full reference and
`docs/PDF-LAYERS.md` for the runtime layer-visibility model.

### Added — `pdfmark` PostScript-to-PDF authoring

`pdfmark` operator dispatch in `stet-ops` (gated behind
`register_pdf_authoring_ops` so it's only visible to systemdict on the
PDF output path) plus matching emitters in `stet-pdf`. Five phases of
authoring support:

- `/DOCINFO` — document info dictionary (title, author, subject,
  keywords, creator, producer, dates, trapped).
- `/OUT` — outline (bookmark) tree authoring with destination /
  action targets.
- `/ANN` — Link, Text, FreeText annotations.
- `/DEST`, `/PAGE`, `/PAGES` — named destinations and per-page-box
  overrides.
- `/VIEWERPREFERENCES`, `/Metadata` — viewer preferences and
  document-level XMP metadata.
- `/Widget` and `/FORM` — AcroForm widget annotations and field-tree
  emission.
- `/EMBED`, JavaScript / Named actions, page-level `/AA` triggers.

See `docs/PDFMARK-AUTHORING.md` for the full reference.

### Added — colour management

- **Hand-rolled colorimetric A2B1 CLUT sampler**
  (`stet-graphics::icc::perceptual`). moxcms 0.8's `create_transform`
  pipeline over-saturates CMYK→sRGB output relative to lcms2 / Acrobat
  / Ghostscript on midtone colours; this module bypasses it for v2
  `lut16Type` CMYK profiles and matches lcms2 RelCol output to ±1 RGB
  level on a 17⁴ sweep against ISO Coated v2 300% (ECI). Out-of-gamut
  colours clip to the sRGB boundary (matching lcms2 / GS) so pure
  process primaries remain saturated. BPC is calibrated against the
  sampler's own (1, 1, 1, 1) output so K-heavy CMYK lands at the
  correct darkness. Profiles whose tables are mAB / mft1 fall back
  to the moxcms-driven bake.
- Soft-mask CMYK-domain blend gate widened to accept Group-wrapped
  flat CMYK fills (GWG 16.11 "Gradient Feather"). The GWG 16.10
  outer-glow protection still rejects on the inner Fill's blend-mode
  check.

### Changed — public API breaking changes

These match-surface enums are now `#[non_exhaustive]` so adding
variants is non-breaking for any consumer that includes a `_ =>` arm.
Existing consumers must add wildcard arms (or update their match
expressions) to keep building.

- `stet-graphics`: `DisplayElement`, `ImageColorSpace`,
  `ShadingColorSpace`, `SpotColorSpace`, `LineCap`, `LineJoin`,
  `FillRule`.
- `stet-core`: `PsError`, `FilterKind`, `RleState`.
- `stet-core::pdfmark`: `PdfMarkRecord`, `AnnotationSubtype`,
  `AnnotationTarget`, `OutlineDestination`, `OutlineAction`,
  `GoToTarget`, `ViewSpec`, `FieldType`, `FieldValue`, `DocDate`,
  `TrappedState`, `TzSign`, `LinkHighlight`, `TextAnnotationIcon`,
  `PageOverrideScope`.
- `stet-pdf-reader`: `PdfError`, `Destination`, `ViewSpec`, `Action`,
  `AnnotationDate`, `AnnotationKind`, `AnnotationColor`,
  `AnnotationKindData`, `FieldKind`, `ButtonType`, `FieldValue`,
  `TrappedFlag`, `PageLayout`, `PageMode`, `ReadingDirection`,
  `PrintScaling`, `Duplex`, `AfRelationship`, `ParsePhase`,
  `LocationHint`, `Severity`, `RenderIntent`, `LayerIntent`,
  `UsageState`, `PageElementSubtype`, `LayerTreeNode`, `BaseState`,
  `ListMode`, `AutoStateEvent`.

Param **structs** (`FillParams`, `StrokeParams`, `ImageParams`, the
pdfmark record structs, `Annotation`, `FormField`, `Layer`, etc.) are
**not** marked `#[non_exhaustive]` — adding fields lands additively
and consumers should pattern-match with `..` for forward
compatibility.

A `scripts/check-non-exhaustive.sh` audit runs in the local pre-push
hook; new public enums in the listed files must either carry the
marker or be allow-listed with a one-line justification. See the
"Stable extension points" section of CLAUDE.md and the per-doc
"Stability" sections of `docs/DISPLAY-LIST.md`,
`docs/PDF-READER-API.md`, and `docs/PDFMARK-AUTHORING.md`.

### Changed — other

- **`stet-pdf`**: removed the PDF/X-3 OutputIntent emission. The writer
  was emitting soft-mask transparency (prohibited by PDF/X-3) while
  labelling output as `PDF/X-3:2003` — a conformance conflict any
  preflight tool would flag. PDF output is now plain PDF 1.7 with no
  PDF/X conformance claim. A correct PDF/X-4 implementation is
  planned.
- **`stet-pdf`**: `PdfDevice::set_output_profile()` is `#[deprecated]`
  as a no-op. Retained for forward API compatibility with the planned
  PDF/X-4 work.
- **`stet-cli`**: `--width` / `--height` flags for PDF input override
  the page's MediaBox at render time.

### Added — documentation

- `docs/PDF-READER-API.md` — full reference for the structural API.
- `docs/PDF-LAYERS.md` — full reference for the OCG / layer API.
- `docs/PDF-EXTENSIONS.md` — full reference for the imaging extension
  operators and the JBIG2 / JPX filters.
- `docs/PDFMARK-AUTHORING.md` — full reference for the pdfmark
  authoring bridge.
- New **Rendering Correctness** section in the root README covering
  seam-free rendering on adjacent clipped regions and full overprint
  simulation.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-20

Backfilled 2026-08-27. This release was tagged and published but never written
up, which `scripts/check-tags.sh` caught when it began requiring a CHANGELOG
entry for every `vX.Y.Z` tag. Only `stet` and `stet-cli` were bumped; the
workspace version stayed at 0.1.0, which is why no other crate carries a 0.1.2.

### Fixed

- **`stet-cli` 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 shipped without embedded-resource
  registration** and were yanked from crates.io. The `stet` binary fell back
  to a PNG-writing rasterizer whenever a PostScript file was opened in the
  interactive viewer. 0.1.2 is self-contained; users of the earlier versions
  needed `cargo install stet-cli --force`. The `stet` library crate, used via
  `Interpreter`, was never affected.
- The root `resources/` tree was retired in favour of crate-local trees, then
  partially restored when `stet-cli` turned out to still read it at runtime;
  `stet-wasm` was pointed at the crate-local tree in the same pass.

There was no `v0.1.1` tag.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-18

Initial public release.

### PostScript interpreter

- Level 3 interpreter with ~320 operators covering stack, math, type,
  dict, array, string, control, file, graphics state, path construction,
  painting, clipping, colour, font, show, image, halftone/transfer,
  pattern/device, resource, and param categories.
- Arena + entity-indirection memory model with full save/restore (COW).
- Dual VM (local/global) with unified stores and `vm_alloc_mode`.
- Name interning via `NameTable`; dict version cache for O(1) name
  resolution on the hot path.
- Full Type 1, CFF/Type 2, Type 3, TrueType, and Type 42 (CID) font
  support with URW substitutions for the 35 standard PostScript fonts.
- Eexec, ASCIIHex, ASCII85, RLE, Flate, LZW, DCT, SubFile, and their
  encode counterparts as streaming filters.
- CIE-based colour spaces (A/ABC/DEF/DEFG) and ICC-based via moxcms.
- Smooth shading types 1–7 (function, axial, radial, triangle meshes,
  Coons/tensor patches) with native PS function evaluation.

### PDF reader (`stet-pdf-reader`)

- Self-contained PDF parser: xref (including xref streams), decryption
  (RC4/AES), object-stream decompression, page tree, resource
  resolution.
- Content-stream interpreter producing the same `DisplayList` type the
  PostScript interpreter produces — **no dependency on `stet-core`**.
- Transparency groups, soft masks (alpha & luminosity), tiling
  patterns, shadings 1–7.
- All standard stream filters including Flate (with PNG predictors),
  LZW, DCT (two backends), CCITT, JBIG2, JPEG 2000, ASCII85, ASCIIHex.
- Optional Content Groups (OCG) captured in the display list for future
  layer toggling.
- PDF OutputIntent profile honoured by default for PDF/X documents.
- CJK CMap loading (poppler-data / `STET_CMAP_DIR`).

### Rendering (`stet-render`)

- tiny-skia–based rasterizer (vendored as `stet-tiny-skia`) producing
  RGBA output.
- Banded rendering sized to L2 cache; rayon-parallel band processing.
- Clip fast path with rect detection, mask caching, and spare mask
  recycling.
- Viewport rendering: render any rectangular region of a display list
  at any zoom without re-interpreting the source.
- ICC-aware CMYK path with black-point compensation and per-pixel
  consistency checks for transparency-group blending.
- Overprint simulation (OPM 0/1), including strict OPM-1 "preserve
  zero components" semantics.
- Hairline and stroke-adjust handling for thin lines.

### PDF output (`stet-pdf`)

- Display list → PDF with embedded fonts (Type 1, TrueType, CFF),
  image compression, shadings, and transparency groups.
- Preserves native CMYK and spot colour spaces (Separation, DeviceN)
  without lossy RGB round-tripping.
- Pre-sampled transfer, halftone, and black-generation/UCR tables
  carried per paint element.
- Print-workflow quality output suitable for pre-press.

### Viewer & frontends

- `stet-viewer`: egui desktop viewer with pan/zoom, minimap,
  multi-page navigation, and drag-and-drop.
- On-demand viewport rendering: zoom/pan without re-interpretation.
- WASM frontend (`stet-wasm`, excluded from the main workspace):
  browser-side PDF viewer with viewport rendering and SIMD-enabled
  tiny-skia.

### Public library API (`stet` facade)

- `Interpreter::new()` / `Interpreter::builder()` for batteries-included
  PostScript rendering.
- `render()` → RGBA pages, `render_to_display_list()` → display lists,
  `render_to_pdf()` → PDF bytes, `exec()` → side-effects only.
- All 53 resources (fonts, encodings, CMaps, ICC profile) embedded in
  the binary via `include_bytes!`.
- Example programs: `render_ps`, `render_pdf`, `display_list`.

### Workspace

- 13 crates under Apache-2.0 OR MIT, plus two vendored tiny-skia forks
  (`stet-tiny-skia`, `stet-tiny-skia-path`) under BSD-3-Clause.
- `stet-pdf-reader` is intentionally independent of `stet-core` — it
  can be used as a standalone PDF parser/renderer without pulling in
  the PostScript VM.
