## About

stet combines a full PostScript Level 3 interpreter and a PDF reader with a
unified graphics pipeline built around a single display-list representation.

Both formats are interpreted into the same display list, so every rendering
and output path works regardless of the source format. Display lists can be
rendered to PNG or PDF, inspected and processed by your own code, or shown
interactively in a native desktop viewer or a browser-based WASM viewer.

The PostScript interpreter and PDF reader are independent — use either or
both. The PDF reader also exposes document structure: outlines, annotations,
form fields, layers, and embedded files.

## Getting started

Three ways in. Pick the row that matches what you are doing:

| I want to… | Start here | More |
|---|---|---|
| **See what it does, right now** | Open the [browser sampler](https://andycappdev.github.io/stet/) and drop a PS, EPS or PDF file on the page. Nothing to install, nothing uploaded — it renders client-side. | [Try it online](#try-it-online) |
| **Render files on my machine or in a pipeline** | [Download a prebuilt binary](#download-a-prebuilt-binary) — no Rust toolchain needed — or `cargo install stet-cli`. | [Install](#install) · [CLI usage](#cli-usage) |
| **Build rendering into my own program** | Add the `stet` crate to your `Cargo.toml`. Pure Rust: no C dependencies and no system libraries to install. | [Library usage](#library-usage) |

## Try it online

Try it at **<https://andycappdev.github.io/stet/>** — drop a PS, EPS,
or PDF file onto the page and stet renders it client-side, no install
required.

This is a **capability sampler, not a production viewer**:

- **No system fonts.** A browser WASM sandbox can't reach the OS font
  directories, so font coverage is limited to the 35 URW fonts embedded
  in the binary plus whatever the source PDF embeds. Documents that
  expect a specific unembedded font will fall back to a URW substitute.
- **Fixed zoom stops** (fit, 75, 150, 300, 600 DPI) rather than
  arbitrary zoom — re-rasterizing at every scroll was too slow in
  single-threaded WASM to feel responsive.
- **Single-threaded WASM.** No rayon parallelism. Rendering is ~2-4× slower
  than native stet.

For production work, use a native binary — see [Install](#install).

## Install

### Download a prebuilt binary

No Rust toolchain required. Archives for Linux, macOS and Windows are
attached to each [release](https://github.com/AndyCappDev/stet/releases/latest),
alongside a `SHA256SUMS` file to check them against.

| Platform | Archive | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux — servers, CI, containers | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | Statically linked. No glibc version requirement, no runtime libraries, no GUI. **Start here on a server.** |
| Linux — desktop | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Includes the interactive viewer. Needs glibc 2.35+ (Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 or newer) and X11/Wayland + OpenGL to open a window; rendering to files needs neither. |
| macOS — Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` | |
| macOS — Intel | `x86_64-apple-darwin` | |
| Windows | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `.zip`. Statically linked CRT, so no redistributable to install. |

Everything is embedded in the binary — 35 fonts, init scripts, encodings and
ICC profiles — so the archive holds the executable and the licences, and
there is nothing to install alongside it.

**Linux and macOS.** Pick the archive from the table above and drop its name
in — the rest of the command is the same for all four:

```bash
ASSET=stet-0.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz     # see the table above

curl -L "https://github.com/AndyCappDev/stet/releases/download/v0.8.2/$ASSET" | tar xz
cd "${ASSET%.tar.gz}"
./stet --version
```

On macOS, `uname -m` tells you which to take: `arm64` → `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
`x86_64` → `x86_64-apple-darwin`.

**Use `curl` on macOS rather than a browser.** The binaries are unsigned, and
Gatekeeper quarantines whatever a browser downloads, so a double-click gives
"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified". The quarantine
attribute is set by the downloading application and `curl` sets none, which
sidesteps it entirely. If you already downloaded through a browser, clear the
flag with `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine stet`.

**Windows.** PowerShell aliases `curl` to `Invoke-WebRequest`, which takes
different arguments — so call `curl.exe` explicitly. Windows 10 1803 and later
ship both it and `tar`:

```powershell
curl.exe -L -O https://github.com/AndyCappDev/stet/releases/download/v0.8.2/stet-0.8.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
tar -xf stet-0.8.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
cd stet-0.8.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
.\stet.exe --version
```

SmartScreen warns that the publisher is unknown on first run; choose
*More info → Run anyway*. Code-signing certificates cost money and stet does
not have one.

**Verify the download.** Each release carries a `SHA256SUMS` file listing
every archive. The quick commands above stream the archive straight into
`tar`, so nothing is left on disk to check against it — to verify, save the
file first:

```bash
ASSET=stet-0.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz     # see the table above
URL=https://github.com/AndyCappDev/stet/releases/download/v0.8.2/

curl -L -O "$URL$ASSET"
curl -L -O "${URL}SHA256SUMS"
grep "$ASSET" SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c -             # prints "<file>: OK"
tar xzf "$ASSET"
```

macOS ships no `sha256sum`; substitute `shasum -a 256 -c -` in that line.

On Windows, PowerShell has no `sha256sum` either, and `Get-FileHash` returns
an upper-case digest while `SHA256SUMS` is lower-case, so compare them
case-folded:

```powershell
$name = "stet-0.8.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
curl.exe -L -O https://github.com/AndyCappDev/stet/releases/download/v0.8.2/SHA256SUMS
$want = ((Select-String -Path SHA256SUMS -SimpleMatch $name).Line -split '\s+')[0]
$got  = (Get-FileHash $name -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
if ($got -eq $want) { "OK" } else { "MISMATCH" }
```

### Install with cargo

```bash
cargo install stet-cli
```

Builds the `stet` binary with the interactive viewer included. Needs a Rust
toolchain (1.88+), and compiles the workspace including the GUI stack, so it
takes appreciably longer than downloading a binary.

For a headless build with no viewer and no GUI dependencies:

```bash
cargo install stet-cli --no-default-features
```

### Build from source

To work from a checkout, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Use it as a library

To call stet from your own Rust program rather than the command line, see
[Library Usage](#library-usage).

## CLI Usage

stet auto-detects the input format — PostScript, EPS, or PDF — so the same
commands work against any of them.

```bash
stet --device png document.ps          # PostScript → PNG
stet --device pdf document.ps          # PostScript → PDF
stet --device png document.pdf         # PDF → PNG
stet document.ps                       # Interactive viewer
stet                                   # REPL (viewer opens on first showpage)
stet inspect document.pdf              # Print PDF structural summary
stet text document.pdf                 # Print the text a file shows
```

See the [Viewer Guide](docs/VIEWER-GUIDE.md) for keyboard/mouse controls,
zoom presets, minimap navigation, and drag-and-drop.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `--device <TYPE>` | Output: `png`, `pdf`, `viewer` (default), `null` |
| `-o`, `--output <PATH>` | Write output to `PATH` instead of alongside the input. A `%d` token becomes the page number (`%03d` zero-pads); without one, `PATH` is a single file and a second page is an error. One input file at a time. See [Choosing where output goes](#choosing-where-output-goes). With [`stet text`](#stet-text-file), the file for the text: every page in one, `%d` not a template. |
| `--dpi <DPI>` | Resolution (overrides device default; all built-in devices default to 300) |
| `--pages <RANGE>` | Page filter: `1`, `1-5`, `2,4,6` |
| `--page <SIZE>` | Page size for PostScript/EPS input: a named size (`letter`, `legal`, `tabloid`, `ledger`, `executive`, `a0`–`a6`, `b4`, `b5`) or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` in points, e.g. `620x1000`. Add `-landscape` / `-portrait` to orient a named size. See [Page size](#page-size). |
| `--width <PX>` / `--height <PX>` | Scale PDF output to a pixel size (PDF input only; not combinable with `--dpi` or `--page`) |
| `--threads <N>` | Worker-thread count (default: 75 % of cores in viewer mode, 8 otherwise) |
| `--no-icc` | Disable ICC color management entirely |
| `--no-aa` | Disable anti-aliasing |
| `--transparent` | Leave unpainted areas transparent instead of white paper (`--device png` only; straight-alpha RGBA) |
| `--crop-box <llx> <lly> <urx> <ury>` | Render only this region of the page, in points in the PDF's own user space (PDF input, `--device png`, not with `--width`/`--height`) |
| `--output-profile <FILE>` | Generic ICC output profile (also used as source CMYK when `--cmyk-profile` is absent) |
| `--cmyk-profile <FILE>` | Pin the source CMYK ICC profile for CMYK→sRGB conversion |
| `--use-output-intent` | Honour the PDF's embedded OutputIntent as the source CMYK profile (default) |
| `--no-output-intent` | Ignore the PDF's embedded OutputIntent and use the system CMYK profile |
| `--bpc <on\|off\|auto>` | Black-point compensation (default: `auto`, currently equivalent to `on`) |
| `--cmyk-intent <perceptual\|relative>` | Which table of the source CMYK profile drives CMYK conversion (default: `relative`). A print profile's perceptual table carries a darker black — what lcms2, Ghostscript and ImageMagick use by default |
| `--password <PW>` | Password for encrypted PDF input |
| `--timeout <SECONDS>` | Abort a job running longer than this. No limit by default — PostScript is Turing-complete and legitimate jobs run for minutes. Set one for untrusted input |
| `--json` | `stet text` only: print JSON with each line's position instead of plain text. See [`stet text`](#stet-text-file) |
| `--word-boxes` | `stet text --json` only: give each word its position too |
| `--max-vm <MB>` | Ceiling on PostScript VM — strings, arrays, dictionaries (default 8192). Exceeding it raises `VMerror` instead of aborting. Separate from the renderer's image and band buffers, so it does **not** cap rendering resolution |

### Choosing where output goes

By default stet writes next to the input: `doc.pdf` becomes `doc.png`, or
`doc-001.png`, `doc-002.png`, … when it has several pages. `-o` / `--output`
puts the result somewhere you choose, which is what a shell-out pipeline
built around `gs -sOutputFile=` expects:

```bash
stet --device png -o /tmp/preview.png --pages 1 doc.pdf  # exactly this path
stet --device png -o '/tmp/p-%03d.png' doc.pdf           # p-001.png, p-002.png, …
stet --device pdf -o out.pdf in.ps                       # PostScript → chosen PDF
```

The path is a template, and the `%d` in it — not the number of pages — is
what decides the naming. `%d` is replaced by the page number and `%0Nd`
zero-pads it to `N` digits, so `p-%03d.png` yields `p-001.png`. A template
with no token names one file: the single-page case most people want, written
to exactly the path given, with no extension mangling.

Deciding from the template rather than the page count is what lets
PostScript and PDF behave identically here. A PostScript page count is not
knowable in advance — pages appear as `showpage` runs — so page 1's name has
to be committed before anyone knows whether a page 2 is coming. Ghostscript
resolves that by opening the literal path once and streaming every page into
it, which silently leaves several concatenated images in one file (measured
against gs 10.05.1: `-sOutputFile=out.png` on a three-page job gives one
`out.png` holding three PNGs, exit 0, no warning; most viewers stop at the
first and the other two are invisible). stet accepts the same templates but
**stops with an error on the second page instead**, naming a `%03d` form to
use, and leaves page 1 on disk. For PDF input the page count *is* known, so
the same mistake is caught before anything is rendered.

`-o` takes one input file — with several, which output each belongs to is
ambiguous — and does not apply to `--device viewer` or `--device null`,
which write no file. `--device pdf` collects every page into a single PDF, so
a `%d` token there is rejected rather than silently ignored. Writing to
stdout (`-o -`) is not supported yet.

### Page size

A PostScript program is rendered onto whatever page the device provides,
which defaults to US Letter. `%%BoundingBox` does **not** change that for a
plain `%!PS` document — DSC defines it as a description of the artwork's
extent, not a page-size request — so a program drawing outside Letter is
clipped unless it calls `setpagedevice` itself. Ghostscript behaves the same
way. `--page` is how you supply the size from outside:

```bash
stet --device png --page 620x1000 broadside.ps   # explicit, in points
stet --device png --page a4 report.ps            # named size
stet --device png --page a4-landscape report.ps  # swap the dimensions
```

EPS is the exception: an `EPSF` header line or a `.eps` extension makes stet
honour `%%BoundingBox` automatically, and `--page` overrides it when both
apply. For PDF input the page size comes from the document, so `--page` is
rejected there — use `--width` / `--height` to scale the output instead.

### `stet inspect <file.pdf>`

Prints a human-readable summary of the document structure: metadata,
page count and dimensions, outline (bookmark) tree, named destinations,
per-page annotation counts by subtype, AcroForm field summary, embedded
file attachments, and any parse warnings. Read-only; never writes to the
file. See the [PDF Reader API guide](docs/PDF-READER-API.md) for the
underlying library API.

```
$ stet inspect document.pdf
document.pdf

### `stet text <file>`

Prints the text a PDF, PostScript or EPS file shows, a line at a time in
the order the file draws it, each page ending with a form feed. Words set
apart by distance rather than by a space character — as TeX sets them —
come out separated. Invisible text such as an OCR layer is included; text
in layers hidden by default is not. Line assembly is deliberately simple:
content order is kept, and columns, tables and reading order are not
detected.

```bash
stet text document.pdf                       # plain text, every page
stet text -o document.txt document.pdf       # written to a file
stet text --pages 2-3 document.ps            # pages 2 and 3
stet text --json document.pdf                # with each line's position
stet text --json --word-boxes document.pdf   # and each word's
```

`--json` prints `{"pages": [{"page", "width", "height", "lines": [{"text",
"bbox", "vertical", "words": [{"text"}]}]}]}`, with positions in points
from the page's top-left corner, y downward, and each `bbox` as
`[x0, y0, x1, y1]`. `--word-boxes` adds a `bbox` to every word; it records
every glyph's position, which takes more memory. `-o` / `--output`
writes to a file instead of stdout — every selected page in one file, so
`%d` is not a page template here — and `--pages` and `--password` work as
for rendering. The same text is available to library
users: see [Display List Architecture](docs/DISPLAY-LIST.md#textrun).

## Display List Architecture

Unlike rendering engines that interpret and rasterize in a single pass,
stet decouples the two: interpreters produce an intermediate **display
list**, and rendering is a separate step that consumes it.

The display list is a public, iterable Rust data structure — a flat
sequence of painting operations (fills, strokes, images, shadings,
text, groups, clips) that you can walk directly. Emit SVG, extract
structured text or metadata, diff two documents, transform the list
before rendering, feed it to an analysis or ML pipeline, or build a
custom renderer for a non-standard target. Few rendering engines
expose this layer; stet treats it as the interchange format between
parser and consumer — use it for anything you want.

This decoupling also enables viewport rendering at arbitrary zoom
without re-interpretation, pipelined multi-page rendering, trivial
cancellation between render bands, multiple output formats from a
single interpretation pass, and display list caching for repeated
renders at different resolutions. See the
[Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[Display List Reference](docs/DISPLAY-LIST.md) for details.

**Print Production**
- Native CMYK color preservation (no lossy RGB round-trip)
- Separation and DeviceN (spot color) support with tint transforms
- Overprint and overprint mode (OPM) for both rasterizer simulation and PDF output
- Transfer functions, halftone screens, black generation, and undercolor removal carried per display element
- Rendering intent preservation
- Trim box support

## Rendering Correctness

Two issues that plague most PDF and PostScript renderers are handled
correctly here:

- **No seams on shared clip edges.** Anti-aliased clip masks produce
  visible seams where adjacent clipped regions meet — the background
  bleeds through the softened edge. stet uses binary clip coverage
  instead, so AGM (Adobe Graphics Manager) EPS exports and other
  heavily-clipped artwork render without artifacts.
- **Overprint simulation.** Overprint is a print-workflow feature
  where the painter combines with the canvas below instead of
  replacing it. Correct simulation requires honest CMYK blend math,
  knockout group handling, and spot channel preservation — complexity
  that most on-screen renderers skip for historical reasons, treating
  overprint as a print-only concern. The result is that documents
  relying on it render visibly wrong everywhere: Firefox/pdf.js,
  Okular/poppler, Chromium/pdfium, and most others all show incorrect
  colours on PDF/X-4 files and the Ghent Workgroup (GWG) conformance
  test suite. stet simulates overprint rather than ignoring it, and
  support is actively being hardened: the common cases and most GWG
  conformance files render correctly today, but it is not yet
  bug-for-bug Acrobat parity on every edge case.

If you're doing prepress, proofing, or any color-separated output,
these matter more than raw rendering speed.

## Library Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
stet = "0.8"
```

```rust
let mut interp = stet::Interpreter::new();
let pages = interp.render(include_bytes!("document.ps"), 300.0)?;
// pages[0].rgba  — RGBA pixel data (4 bytes/pixel, row-major)
// pages[0].width — pixel width at 300 DPI
```

The `stet` crate embeds all required resources (35 fonts, init scripts,
encodings, ICC color profiles) so there are no external files to ship.

Output formats, diagnostics, viewport rendering, the PDF reader, custom
output devices, feature flags, and the pre-1.0 upgrade notes are in
[docs/LIBRARY-USAGE.md](docs/LIBRARY-USAGE.md).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

stet requires **Rust 1.88** or newer. This is verified on every push by a CI
job that compiles the workspace on exactly that toolchain, so the number above
is a tested fact rather than an estimate.

The MSRV is not covered by semantic versioning: it may be raised in any minor
release. Any change to it is called out in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `stet` | Batteries-included library API (facade) |
| `stet-core` | Interpreter infrastructure: types, VM, tokenizer |
| `stet-ops` | PostScript operator implementations (388 registered in `systemdict`) |
| `stet-engine` | Execution engine (eval loop) |
| `stet-fonts` | Font parsing: Type 1, CFF/Type 2, TrueType |
| `stet-graphics` | Display list, color types, ICC color management |
| `stet-render` | Rasterization backend, PNG output. Depends on `stet-core` only for the default `ps-device` feature; without it a consumer rasterizes display lists with no PostScript VM linked |
| `stet-tiny-skia` | Modified [tiny-skia](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/tiny-skia) fork with stet-specific optimizations (BSD-3-Clause) |
| `stet-tiny-skia-path` | Companion path/stroker crate for `stet-tiny-skia` (BSD-3-Clause) |
| `stet-pdf` | PDF output device (PS → PDF) |
| `stet-pdf-reader` | PDF input parser (PDF → display lists) |
| `stet-viewer` | Interactive egui/winit desktop viewer |
| `stet-cli` | Command-line interface and REPL |
| `stet-wasm` | WebAssembly bindings for browser rendering |

See the [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a detailed explanation
of how these crates work together.

## Contributing

`cargo test` runs with no extra setup. Building from a checkout, the git
hooks, tag naming, the WASM viewer build, and the PDF visual-regression
corpus are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Commercial Support

stet is built and maintained by Scott Bowman and is free under
Apache-2.0 OR MIT with no obligations. If your organization runs it in
production, commercial support and consulting are available — priority
fixes, integration help, and format-coverage work, including guarantees
around the specific PostScript, EPS/AI, or PDF edge cases your pipeline
depends on. Reach out at scott@bowmans.org.

## Acknowledgements

- **[hayro](https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro)** — PDF renderer by
  Laurenz Stampfl. `stet-pdf-reader` uses the project's
  [`hayro-jpeg2000`](https://crates.io/crates/hayro-jpeg2000),
  [`hayro-jbig2`](https://crates.io/crates/hayro-jbig2), and
  [`hayro-ccitt`](https://crates.io/crates/hayro-ccitt) crates for
  JPEG 2000, JBIG2, and CCITT-Fax stream decoding — the PDF filters
  that have no other pure-Rust implementation. Big thanks to the hayro
  project for factoring these out as reusable crates.
- **[tiny-skia](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/tiny-skia)** by
  [Yevhenii Reizner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon) — a Skia subset
  ported to Rust. `stet-tiny-skia` / `stet-tiny-skia-path` are modified
  forks (see each crate's README for the specific changes).
- **[moxcms](https://crates.io/crates/moxcms)** — pure-Rust ICC colour
  management. `stet-graphics` uses it for CMYK↔sRGB conversion, image
  bulk transforms, and black-point compensation.

## License

stet's own code is Apache-2.0 OR MIT. The binary also embeds the URW++
base 35 fonts (GNU AGPL v3 with a font exception) and Adobe's CMap and
glyph-list data (BSD-3-Clause), and links third-party crates under their
own permissive licences. Each prebuilt release archive includes
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` with all of their terms;
`scripts/gen-third-party-notices.sh` generates it for a build from source.

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or
conditions.
